      <h1>Ethic</h1>

      <p>
        We have already had to touch upon the psychology of the Stoics in
        connection with the first principles of logic. It is no less necessary
        to do so now in dealing with the foundation of ethic.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Stoics we are told reckoned that there were eight parts of the soul.
        These were the five senses, the organ of sound, the intellect and the
        reproductive principle. The passions, it will be observed, are
        conspicuous by their absence. For the Stoic theory was that the passions
        were simply the intellect in a diseased state owing to the perversions
        of falsehood. This is why the Stoics would not parley with passion,
        conceiving that if once it were let into the citadel of the soul it
        would supplant the rightful ruler. Passion and reason were not two
        things which could be kept separate in which case it might be hoped that
        reason would control passion, but were two states of the same thing—a
        worse and a better.
      </p>

      <p>
        The unperturbed intellect was the legitimate monarch in the kingdom of
        man. Hence the Stoics commonly spoke of it as the leading principle.
        This was the part of the soul which received phantasies and it was also
        that in which impulses were generated with which we have now more
        particularly to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        Impulse or appetition was the principle in the soul which impelled to
        action. In an unperverted state it was directed only to things in
        accordance with nature. The negative form of this principle or the
        avoidance of things as being contrary to nature, we shall call
        repulsion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notwithstanding the sublime heights to which Stoic morality rose. It was
        professedly based on self-love, wherein the Stoics were at one with the
        other schools of thought in the ancient world.
      </p>

      <p>
        The earliest impulse that appeared in a newly born animal was to protect
        itself and its own constitution which were conciliated to it by nature.
        What tended to its survival, it sought; what tended to its destruction,
        it shunned. Thus self-preservation was the first law of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        While man was still in the merely animal stage, and before reason was
        developed in him, the things that were in accordance with his nature
        were such as health, strength, good bodily condition, soundness of all
        the senses, beauty, swiftness—in short all the qualities that went to
        make up richness of physical life and that contributed to the vital
        harmony. These were called the first things in accordance with nature.
        Their opposites were all contrary to nature, such as sickness, weakness,
        mutilation. Under the first things in accordance with nature came also
        congenial advantages of soul such as quickness of intelligence, natural
        ability, industry, application, memory, and the like. It was a question
        whether pleasure was to be included among the number. Some members of
        the school evidently thought that it might be, but the orthodox opinion
        was that pleasure was a sort of aftergrowth and that the direct pursuit
        of it was deleterious to the organism. The after growths of virtue were
        joy, cheerfulness, and the like. These were the gambolings of the spirit
        like the frolicsomeness of an animal in the full flush of its vitality
        or like the blooming of a plant. For one and the same power manifested
        itself in all ranks of nature, only at each stage on a higher level. To
        the vegetative powers of the plant the animal added sense and Impulse.
        It was in accordance therefore with the nature of an animal to obey the
        Impulses of sense, but to sense and Impulse man superadded reason so
        that when he became conscious of himself as a rational being, it was in
        accordance with his nature to let all his Impulses be shaped by this new
        and master hand. Virtue was therefore pre-eminently in accordance with
        nature. What then we must now ask is the relation of reason to impulse
        as conceived by the Stoics? Is reason simply the guiding, and impulse
        the motive power? Seneca protests against this view, when impulse is
        identified with passion. One of his grounds for doing so is that reason
        would be put on a level with passion, if the two were equally necessary
        for action. But the question is begged by the use of the word 'passion,'
        which was defined by the Stoics as 'an excessive impulse.' Is it
        possible then, even on Stoic principles, for reason to work without
        something different from itself to help it? Or must we say that reason
        is itself a principle of action? Here Plutarch comes to our aid, who
        tells us on the authority of Chrysippus in his work on Law that impulse
        is 'the reason of man commanding him to act,' and similarly that
        repulsion is 'prohibitive reason.' This renders the Stoic position
        unmistakable, and we must accomodate our minds to it in spite of its
        difficulties. Just as we have seen already that reason is not something
        radically different from sense, so now it appears that reason is not
        different from impulse, but itself the perfected form of impulse.
        Whenever impulse is not identical with reason—at least in a rational
        being—it is not truly impulse, but passion.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Stoics, it will be observed, were Evolutionists in their psychology.
        But, like many Evolutionists at the present day, they did not believe in
        the origin of mind out of matter. In all living things there existed
        already what they called 'seminal reasons,' which accounted for the
        intelligence displayed by plants as well as by animals. As there were
        four cardinal virtues, so there were four primary passions. These were
        delight, grief, desire and fear. All of them were excited by the
        presence or the prospect of fancied good or ill. What prompted desire by
        its prospect caused delight by its presence, and what prompted fear by
        its prospect caused grief by its presence. Thus two of the primary
        passions had to do with good and two with evil. All were furies which
        infested the life of fools, rendering it bitter and grievous to them;
        and it was the business of philosophy to fight against them. Nor was
        this strife a hopeless one, since the passions were not grounded in
        nature, but were due to false opinion. They originated in voluntary
        judgements, and owed their birth to a lack of mental sobriety. If men
        wished to live the span of life that was allotted to them in quietness
        and peace, they must by all means keep clear of the passions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The four primary passions having been formulated, it became necessary to
        justify the division by arranging the specific forms of feeling under
        these four heads. In this task the Stoics displayed a subtlety which is
        of more interest to the lexicographer than to the student of philosophy.
        They laid great stress on the derivation of words as affording a clue to
        their meaning; and, as their etymology was bound by no principles, their
        ingenuity was free to indulge in the wildest freaks of fancy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though all passion stood self-condemned, there were nevertheless certain
        'eupathies,' or happy affections, which would be experienced by the
        ideally good and wise man. These were not perturbations of the soul, but
        rather 'constancies'; they were not opposed to reason, but were rather
        part of reason. Though the sage would never be transported with delight,
        he would still feel an abiding 'joy' in the presence of the true and
        only good; he would never indeed be agitated by desire, but still he
        would be animated by 'wish,' for that was directed only to the good; and
        though he would never feel fear still he would be actuated in danger by
        a proper caution.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was therefore something rational corresponding to three out of
        four primary passions—against delight was to be set joy; against grief
        there was nothing to be set, for that arose from the presence of ill
        which would rather never attach to the sage. Grief was the irrational
        conviction that one ought to afflict oneself where there was no occasion
        for it. The ideal of the Stoics was the unclouded serenity of Socrates
        of whom Xanthippe declared that he had always the same face whether on
        leaving the house In the morning or on returning to it at night.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the motley crowd of passions followed the banners of their four
        leaders so specific forms of feeling sanctioned by reason were severally
        assigned to the three eupathies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Things were divided by Zeno into good, bad, and indifferent. To good
        belonged virtue and what partook of virtue; to bad, vice and what
        partook of vice. All other things were indifferent.
      </p>

      <p>
        To the third class then belonged such things as life and death, health
        and sickness, pleasure and pain, beauty and ugliness, strength and
        weakness, honour and dishonour, wealth and poverty, victory and defeat,
        nobility and baseness of birth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Good was defined as that which benefits. To confer benefit was no less
        essential to good than to impart warmth was to heat. If one asked in
        what 'to benefit' lay one received the reply that it lay in producing an
        act or state in accordance with virtue, and similarly it was laid down
        that 'to hurt' lay in producing an act or state in accordance with vice.
      </p>

      <p>
        The indifference of things other than virtue and vice was apparent from
        the definition of good which made it essentially beneficial. Such things
        as health and wealth might be beneficial or not according to
        circumstances; they were therefore no more good than bad. Again, nothing
        could be really good of which the good or ill depended on the use made
        of it, but this was the case with things like health and wealth.
      </p>

      <p>
        The true and only good then was identical with what the Greeks called
        'the beautiful' and what we call 'the right'. To say that a thing was
        right was to say that it was good, and conversely to say that it was
        good was to say that it was right; this absolute identity between the
        good and the right and, on the other hand, between the bad and wrong,
        was the head and front of the Stoic ethics. The right contained in
        itself all that was necessary for the happy life, the wrong was the only
        evil, and made men miserable whether they knew it or not.
      </p>

      <p>
        As virtue was itself the end, it was of course choiceworthy in and for
        itself, apart from hope or fear with regard to its consequences.
        Moreover, as being the highest good, it could admit of no increase from
        the addition of things indifferent. It did not even admit of increase
        from the prolongation of its own existence, for the question was not one
        of quantity, but of quality. Virtue for an eternity was no more virtue,
        and therefore no more good, than virtue for a moment. Even so one circle
        was no more round than another, whatever you might choose to make its
        diameter, nor would it detract from the perfection of a circle if it
        were to be obliterated immediately in the same dust in which it had been
        drawn.
      </p>

      <p>
        To say that the good of men lay in virtue was another way of saying that
        it lay in reason, since virtue was the perfection of reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        As reason was the only thing whereby Nature had distinguished man from
        other creatures, to live the rational life was to follow Nature.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nature was at once the law of God and the law for man. For by the nature
        of anything was meant, not that which we actually find it to be, but
        that which in the eternal fitness of things it was obviously intended to
        become.
      </p>

      <p>
        To be happy then was to be virtuous, to be virtuous was to be rational,
        to be rational was to follow Nature, and to follow Nature was to obey
        God. Virtue imparted to life that even flow in which Zeno declared
        happiness to consist. This was attained when one's own genius was in
        harmony with the will that disposed of all things.
      </p>

      <p>
        Virtue having been purified from all the dross of the emotions, came out
        as something purely intellectual, so that the Stoics agreed with the
        Socratic conception that virtue is knowledge. They also took on from
        Plato the four cardinal virtues of Wisdom, Temperance, Courage, and
        Justice, and defined them as so many branches of knowledge. Against
        these were set four cardinal vices of Folly, Intemperance, Cowardice,
        and Injustice. Under both the virtues and vices there was an elaborate
        classification of specific qualities. But notwithstanding the care with
        which the Stoics divided and subdivided the virtues, virtue, according
        to their doctrine, was all the time one and indivisible. For virtue was
        simply reason and reason, if it were there, must control every
        department of conduct alike. 'He who has one virtue has all,' was a
        paradox with which the Greek thought was already familiar. But
        Chrysippus went beyond this, declaring that he who displayed one virtue
        did thereby display all. Neither was the man perfect who did not possess
        all the virtues, nor was the act perfect which did not involve them all.
        Where the virtues differed from one another was merely in the order in
        which they put things. Each was primarily itself, secondarily all the
        rest. Wisdom had to determine what it was right to do, but this involved
        the other virtues. Temperance had to impart stability to the impulses,
        but how could the term 'temperate' be applied to a man who deserted his
        post through cowardice, or who failed to return a deposit through
        avarice, which is a form of injustice, or yet to one who misconducted
        affairs through rashness, which falls under folly? Courage had to face
        dangers and difficulties, but it was not courage unless its cause were
        just. Indeed one of the ways in which courage was defined was a virtue
        fighting on behalf of justice. Similarly justice put first the assigning
        to each man his due, but in the act of doing so had to bring in the
        other virtues. In short, it was the business of the man of virtue to
        know and to do what ought to be done, for what ought to be done implied
        wisdom in choice, courage in endurance, justice in assignment and
        temperance in abiding by ones conviction. One virtue never acted by
        itself, but always on the advice of a committee. The obverse to this
        paradox—He who has one vice has all vices—was a conclusion which the
        Stoics did not shrink from drawing. One might lose part of one's
        Corinthian ware and still retain the rest, but to lose one virtue—if
        virtue could be lost—would be to lose all along with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have now encountered the first paradox of Stoicism, and can discern
        its origin in the identification of virtue with pure reason. In getting
        forth the novelties in Zeno's teaching, Cicero mentions that, while his
        predecessors had recognized virtues due to nature and habit, he made all
        dependent upon reason. A natural consequence of this was the reassertion
        of the position which Plato held or wished to hold, namely, that virtue
        can be taught. But the part played by nature in virtue cannot be
        ignored. It was not in the power of Zeno to alter facts. All he could do
        was to legislate as to names. And this he did vigorously. Nothing was to
        be called virtue which was not of the nature of reason and knowledge,
        but still it had to be admitted that nature supplied the starting points
        for the four cardinal virtues—for the discovery of one's impulses, for
        right endurances and harmonious distributions.
      </p>

      <p>
        From things good and bad we now turn to things indifferent. Hitherto the
        Stoic doctrine has been stern and uncompromising. We have now to look at
        it under a different aspect, and to see how it tried to conciliate
        common sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        By things indifferent were meant such as did not necessarily contribute
        to virtue, for instance health, wealth, strength, and honor. It is
        possible to have all these and not be virtuous, it is possible also to
        be virtuous without them. But we have now to learn that though these
        things are neither good nor evil, and are therefore not matter for
        choice or avoidance, they are far from being indifferent in the sense of
        arousing neither impulse nor repulsion. There are things indeed that are
        indifferent in the latter sense, such as whether you put out your finger
        this way or that, whether you stoop to pick up a straw or not, whether
        the number of hairs on your head be odd or even. But things of this sort
        are exceptional. The bulk of things other than virtue and vice do arouse
        in us either impulse or repulsion. Let it be understood then that there
        are two senses of the word indifferent—
      </p>

      <p>
        (1) neither good nor bad<br />
        (2) neither awaking impulse nor repulsion
      </p>

      <p>
        Among things indifferent in the former sense, some were in accordance
        with nature, some were contrary to nature and some were neither one nor
        the other. Health, strengths and soundness of the senses were in
        accordance with nature; sickness weakness and mutilation were contrary
        to nature, but such things as the fallibility of the soul and the
        vulnerability of the body were neither in accordance with nature nor yet
        contrary to nature, but just nature.
      </p>

      <p>
        All things that were in accordance with nature had 'value' and all
        things that were contrary to nature had what we must call 'disvalue'. In
        the highest sense indeed of the term 'value'—namely that of absolute
        value or worth—things indifferent did not possess any value at all. But
        still there might be assigned to them what Antipater expressed by the
        term 'a selective value' or what he expressed by its barbarous
        privative, 'a disselective disvalue'. If a thing possessed a selective
        value you took that thing rather than its contrary, supposing that
        circumstances allowed, for instance, health rather than sickness, wealth
        rather than poverty, life rather than death. Hence such things were
        called takeable and their contraries untakeable. Things that possessed a
        high degree of value were called preferred, those that possessed a high
        degree of disvalue were called rejected. Such as possessed no
        considerable degree of either were neither preferred nor rejected. Zeno,
        with whom these names originated, justified their use about things
        really indifferent on the ground that at court "preferment" could not be
        bestowed upon the king himself, but only on his ministers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Things preferred and rejected might belong to mind, body or estate.
        Among things preferred in the case of the mind were natural ability,
        art, moral progress, and the like, while their contraries were rejected.
        In the case of the body, life, health, strength, good condition,
        completeness, and beauty were preferred, while death, sickness,
        weakness, ill condition, mutilation and ugliness were rejected. Among
        things external to soul and body, wealth, reputation, and nobility were
        preferred, while poverty, ill repute, and baseness of birth were
        rejected.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this way all mundane and marketable goods, after having been solemnly
        refused admittance by the Stoics at the front door, were smuggled in at
        a kind of tradesman's entrance under the name of things indifferent. We
        must now see how they had, as it were, two moral codes, one for the sage
        and the other for the world in general.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sage alone could act rightly, but other people might perform "the
        proprieties." Any one might honor his parents, but the sage alone did it
        as the outcome of wisdom, because he alone possessed the art of life,
        the peculiar work of which was to do everything that was done as the
        result of the best disposition. All the acts of the sage were "perfect
        proprieties," which were called "rightnesses." All acts of all other men
        were sins or "wrongnesses." At their best they could only be
        "intermediate proprieties." The term "propriety," then, is a generic
        one. But, as often happens, the generic term got determined in use to a
        specific meaning, so that intermediate acts are commonly spoken of as
        "proprieties" in opposition to "rightnesses." Instances of "rightnesses"
        are displaying wisdom and dealing justly, instances of proprieties or
        intermediate acts are marrying, going on an embassy, and dialectic.
      </p>

      <p>
        The word "duty" is often employed to translate the Greek term which we
        are rendering by "propriety." Any translation is no more than a choice
        of evils, since we have no real equivalent for the term. It was
        applicable not merely to human conduct, but also to the acting of the
        lower animals, and even to the growth of plants. Now, apart from a craze
        of generalization we should hardly think of the "stern daughter of the
        voice of God" in connection with an amoeba corresponding successfully to
        stimulus, yet the creature in its inchoate way is exhibiting a dim
        analogy to duty. The term in question was first used by Zeno, and was
        explained by him, in accordance with its etymology, to mean what it came
        to one to do, so that as far as this goes, 'becomingness' would be the
        most appropriate translation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sphere of propriety was confined to things indifferent, so that
        there were proprieties which were common to the sage and the fool. It
        had to do with taking the things which were in accordance with nature
        and rejecting those that were not. Even the propriety of living or dying
        was determined, not by reference to virtue or vice, but to the
        preponderance or deficiency of things in accordance with nature. It
        might thus be a propriety for the sage in spite of his happiness, to
        depart from life of his own accord, and for the fool notwithstanding his
        misery, to remain in it. Life, being in itself indifferent, the whole
        question was one of opportunism. Wisdom might prompt the leaving herself
        should occasion seem to call for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        We pass on now another instance of accommodation. According to the high
        Stoic doctrine, there was no mean between virtue and vice. All men
        indeed received from nature the starting-points for virtue, but until
        perfection had been attained they rested under the condemnation of vice.
        It was, to employ an illustration of the poet-philosopher Cleanthes, as
        though Nature had begun an iambic line and left men to finish it. Until
        that was done they were to wear the fool's cap. The Peripatetics, on the
        other hand, recognized an intermediate state between virtue and vice, to
        which they gave the name of progress and proficience. Yet so entirely
        had the Stoics, for practical purposes, to accept this lower level, that
        the word "proficience" has come to be spoken of as though it were of
        Stoic origin.

      <p>
        Seneca is fond of contrasting the sage with the proficient. The sage is
        like a man in the enjoyment of perfect health. But the proficient is
        like a man recovering from a severe illness, with whom an abatement of
        the paroxysm is equivalent to health, and who is always in danger of a
        relapse. It is the business of philosophy to provide for the needs of
        these weaker brethren. The proficient is still called a fool, but it is
        pointed out that he is a very different kind of fool from the rest.
        Further, proficients are arranged into three classes, in a way that
        reminds one of the technicalities of Calvinistic theology. First of all,
        there are those who are near wisdom, but, however near they may be to
        the door of Heaven, they are still on the wrong side of it. According to
        some doctors, these were already safe from backsliding, differing from
        the sage only in not having yet realized that they had attained to
        knowledge; other authorities, however, refused to admit this, and
        regarded the first class as being exempt only from settled diseases of
        the soul, but not from passing attacks of passion. Thus did the Stoics
        differ among themselves as to the doctrine of "final assurance". The
        second class consisted of those who had laid aside the worst diseases
        and passions of the soul, but might at any moment relapse into them. The
        third class was of those who had escaped one mental malady but not
        another; who had conquered lust, let us say, but not ambition; who
        disregarded death, but dreaded pain, This third class, adds Seneca, is
        by no means to be despised.

        From these concessions to the weakness of humanity we now pass to the
        Stoic paradoxes, where we shall see their doctrine in its full rigor. It
        is perhaps these very paradoxes which account for the puzzled
        fascination with which Stoicism affected the mind of antiquity, just as
        obscurity in a poet may prove a surer passport to fame than more
        strictly poetical merits.
      </p>

      <p>
        The root of Stoicism being a paradox, it is not surprising that the
        offshoots should be so too. To say that "Virtue is the highest good" is
        a proposition to which every one who aspires to the spiritual life must
        yield assent with his lips, even if he has not yet learned to believe it
        in his heart. But alter it into "Virtue is the only good" and by that
        slight change it becomes at once the teeming mother of paradoxes. By a
        paradox is meant that which runs counter to general opinion. Now it is
        quite certain that men have regarded, do regard, and, we may safely add
        will regard things as good which are not virtue. But if we grant this
        initial paradox, a great many others will follow along with it—as for
        instance that "Virtue is sufficient of itself for happiness". The fifth
        book of Cicero's Tusculan Disputations is an eloquent defense of this
        thesis, in which the orator combats the suggestion that a good man is
        not happy when he is being broken on the wheel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another glaring paradox of the Stoics is that "All faults are equal".
        They took their stand upon a mathematical conception of rectitude. An
        angle must be either a right angle or not, a line must be either
        straight or crooked, so an act must be either right or wrong. There is
        no mean between the two and there are no degrees of either. To sin is to
        cross the line. When once that has been done it makes no difference to
        the offense how far you go. Trespassing at all is forbidden. This
        doctrine was defended by the Stoics on account of its bracing moral
        effect as showing the heinousness of sin. Horace gives the judgment of
        the world in saying that common sense and morality, to say nothing of
        utility, revolt against it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are some other specimens of the Stoic paradoxes. "Every fool is
        mad". "Only the sage is free and every fool is a slave". "The sage alone
        is wealthy". "Good men are always happy and bad men always miserable".
        "All goods are equal". "No one is wiser or happier than another". But
        may not one man we ask be more nearly wise or more nearly happy than
        another? "That may be", the Stoics would reply, "but the man who is only
        one stade from Canopus is as much not in Canopus as the man who is a
        hundred stades off; and the eight day old puppy is still as blind as on
        the day of its birth; nor can a man who is near the surface of the sea
        breathe any more than if he were full five hundred fathom down".
      </p>

      <p>
        It is only fair to the Stoics to add that paradoxes were quite the order
        of the day in Greece, though they greatly outdid other schools in
        producing them. Socrates himself was the father of paradox. Epicurus
        maintained as staunchly as any Stoic that "No wise man is unhappy", and,
        if he be not belied, went the length of declaring that the wise man, if
        put into the bull of Phalaris would exclaim: "How delightful! How little
        I mind this!"
      </p>

      <p>
        It is out of keeping with common sense to draw a hard and fast
        distinction between good and bad. Yet this was what the Stoics did. They
        insisted on effecting here and now that separation between the sheep and
        the goats, which Christ postponed to the Day of Judgment. Unfortunately,
        when it came to practice, all were found to be goats, so that the
        division was a merely formal one.
      </p>

      <p>
        The good man of the Stoics was variously known as 'the sage', or, 'the
        serious man', the latter name being inherited from the Peripatetics. We
        used to hear it said among ourselves that a person had become serious,
        when he or she had taken to religion. Another appellation which the
        Stoics had for the sage was 'the urbane man', while the fool in
        contradistinction was called 'a boor'. Boorishness was defined as an
        inexperience of the customs and laws of the state. By the state was
        meant, not Athens or Sparta, as would have been the case in a former
        age, but the society of all rational beings into which the Stoics
        spiritualised the state. The sage alone had the freedom of this city and
        the fool was therefore not only a boor, but an alien or an exile. In
        this city, Justice was natural and not conventional, for the law by
        which it was governed was the law of right reason. The law then was
        spiritualised by the Stoics, just as the state was. It no longer meant
        the enactments of this or that community, but the mandates of the
        eternal reason which ruled the world and which would prevail in the
        ideal state. Law was defined as right reason commanding what was to be
        done and forbidding what was not to be done. As such, it in no way
        differed from the impulse of the sage himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a member of a state and by nature subject to law, man was essentially
        a social being. Between all the wise there existed "unanimity," which
        was "a knowledge of the common good," because their views of life were
        harmonious. Fools, on the other hand, whose views of life were
        discordant, were enemies to one another and bent on mutual injury.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a member of society the sage would play his part in public life.
        Theoretically this was always true, and practically he would do so,
        wherever the actual constitution made any tolerable approach to the
        ideal type. But, if the circumstances were such as to make it certain
        that his embarking on politics would be of no service to his country,
        and only a source of danger to himself, then he would refrain. The kind
        of constitution of which the Stoics most approved was a mixed government
        containing democratic, aristocratic, and monarchical elements. Where
        circumstances allowed the sage would act as legislator, and would
        educate mankind, one way of doing which was by writing books which would
        prove of profit to the reader.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a member of existing society the sage would marry and beget children,
        both for his own sake and for that of his country, on behalf of which,
        if it were good, he would be ready to suffer and die. Still he would
        look forward to a better time when, in Zeno's as in Plato's republic,
        the wise would have women and children in common, when the elders would
        love all the rising generation equally with parental fondness, and when
        marital jealousy would be no more.
      </p>

      <p>
        As being essentially a social being, the sage was endowed not only with
        the graver political virtues, but also with the graces of life. He was
        sociable, tactful and stimulating, using conversation as a means for
        promoting good will and friendship; so far as might be, he was all
        things to all men, which made him fascinating and charming, insinuating
        and even wily; he know how to hit the point and to choose the right
        moment, yet with it all he was plain and unostentatious and simple and
        unaffected; in particular he never delighted in irony much less in
        sarcasm.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the social characteristics of the sage we turn now to a side of his
        character which appears eminently anti-social. One of his most highly
        vaunted characteristics was his self-sufficingness. He was to be able to
        step out of a burning city, coming from the wreck not only of his
        fortunes, but of his friends and family, and to declare with a smile
        that he has lost nothing. All that he truly cared for was to be centered
        in himself. Only thus could he be sure that Fortune would not wrest it
        from him.
      </p>

      <p>
        The apathy or passionlessness of the sage is another of his most salient
        features. The passions being, on Zeno's showing, not natural, but forms
        of disease, the sage, as being the perfect man, would of course be
        wholly free from them. They were so many disturbances of the even flow
        in which his bliss lay. The sage therefore would never be moved by a
        feeling of favour towards any one; he would never pardon a fault; he
        would never feel pity; he would never be prevailed upon by entreaty; he
        would never be stirred to anger.
      </p>

      <p>
        As to the absence of pity in the sage, the Stoics themselves must have
        felt some difficulty there since we find Epictetus recommending his
        hearers to show grief out of sympathy for another, but to be careful not
        to feel it. The inexorability of the sage was a mere consequence of his
        calm reasonableness, which would lead him to take the right view from
        the first. Lastly, the sage would never be stirred to anger. For why
        should it stir his anger to see another in his ignorance injuring
        himself?
      </p>

      <p>
        One more touch has yet to be added to the apathy of the sage. He was
        impervious to wonder. No miracle of nature could excite his
        astonishment—no mephitic caverns, which men deemed the mouths of hell,
        no deep-drawn ebb tides—the standing marvel of the Mediterranean
        dweller, no hot springs, no spouting jets of fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the absence of passion it is but a step to the absence of error. So
        we pass now to the infallibility of the sage—a monstrous doctrine which
        was never broached in the schools before Zeno. The sage, it was
        maintained, held no opinions, he never repented of his conduct, he was
        never deceived in anything. Between the daylight of knowledge and
        darkness of nescience Plato had interposed the twilight of opinion
        wherein men walked for the most part. Not so however the Stoic sage. Of
        him it might be said, as Charles Lamb said of the Scotchman with whom he
        so imperfectly sympathized: "His understanding is always at its
        meridian—you never see the first dawn, the early streaks." He has no
        falterings of self suspicion. Surmises, guesses, misgivings, half
        intuitions, semiconsciousness, partial illuminations, dim instincts,
        embryo conceptions, have no place in his brain or vocabulary. The
        twilight of dubiety never falls upon him. Opinion, whether in the form
        of an ungripped assent, or a weak supposition, was alien from the mental
        disposition of the serious man. With him there was no hasty or premature
        assent of the understanding, no forgetfulness, no distrust. He never
        allowed himself to be overreached or deluded, never had need of an
        arbiter, never was out in his reckoning nor put out by another. No
        urbane man ever wandered from his way, or missed his mark, or saw wrong,
        or heard amiss, or erred in any of his senses; he never conjectured nor
        thought of a better thing, for the one was a form of imperfect assent,
        and the other a sign of previous precipitancy. There was with him no
        change, no retraction, and no tripping. These things were for those
        whose dogmas could alter. After this it is almost superfluous for us to
        be assured that the sage never got drunk. Drunkenness, as Zeno pointed
        out, involved babbling, and of that the sage would never be guilty. He
        would not, however, altogether eschew banquets. Indeed, the Stoics
        recognized a virtue under the name of 'conviviality,' which consisted in
        the proper conduct of them. It was said of Chrysippus that his demeanor
        was always quiet, even if his gait were unsteady, so that his
        housekeeper declared that only his legs were drunk.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were pleasantries even within the school on this subject of
        infallibility of the sage. Aristo of Chios, while seceding on some other
        matters, held fast to the dogma that the sage never opined. Whereupon
        Persaeus played a trick upon him. He made one of two twin brothers
        deposit a sum of money with him and the other call to reclaim it. The
        success of the trick however only went to establish that Aristo was not
        the sage, an admission which each of the Stoics seems to have been ready
        enough to make on his own part, as the responsibilities of the position
        were so fatiguing.
      </p>

      <p>
        There remains one more leading characteristic of the sage, the most
        striking of them all, and the most important from the ethical point of
        view. This was his innocence or harmlessness. He would not harm others
        and was not to be harmed by them. For the Stoics believed with Socrates
        that it was not permissible by the divine law for a better man to be
        harmed by a worse. You could not harm the sage any more than you could
        harm the sunlight; he was in our world, but not of it. There was no
        possibility of evil for him, save in his own will, and that you could
        not touch. And as the sage was beyond harm, so also was he above insult.
        Men might disgrace themselves by their insolent attitude towards his
        mild majesty, but it was not in their power to disgrace him.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the Stoics had their analogue to the tenet of final assurance, so had
        they also to that of sudden conversion. They held that a man might
        become a sage without being at first aware of it. The abruptness of the
        transition from folly to wisdom was in keeping with their principle that
        there was no medium between the two, but it was naturally a point which
        attracted the strictures of their opponents. That a man should be at one
        moment stupid and ignorant and unjust and intemperate, a slave and poor,
        and destitute, at the next a king, rich, and prosperous, temperate, and
        just, secure in his judgements and exempt from error, was a
        transformation, they declared, which smacked more of the fairy tales of
        the nursery than of the doctrines of a sober philosophy.
