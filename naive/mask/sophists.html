      <h1>Sophists</h1>

      <p>
        A certain analogy may perhaps be discerned between the progression of
        philosophic thought in Greece as we have traced it, and the political
        development which had its course in almost every Greek state during the
        same period. The Ionic philosophy may be regarded as corresponding with
        the kingly era in Greek politics. Philosophy sits upon the heights and
        utters its authoritative dicta for the resolution of the seeming
        contradictions of things. One principle is master, but the testimony of
        the senses is not denied; a harmony of thought and sensation is sought
        in the interpretation of appearances by the light of a ruling idea. In
        Pythagoras and his order we have an aristocratic organisation of
        philosophy. Its truths are for the few, the best men are the teachers,
        equal as initiated partakers in the mysteries, supreme over all outside
        their society. A reasoned and reasonable order and method are symbolised
        by their theory of Number; their philosophy is political, their politics
        oligarchic. In the Eleatic school we have a succession of personal
        attempts to construct a domination in the theory of Nature; some ideal
        conception is attempted to be so elevated above the data of sensation as
        to override them altogether, and the general result we are now to see
        throughout the philosophic world, as it was seen also throughout the
        world of politics, in a total collapse of the principle of forced
        authority, and a development, of successively nearer approaches to
        anarchic individualism and doubt. The notion of an ultimately true and
        real, whatever form it might assume in various theorists' hands, being
        in its essence apart from and even antagonistic to the perceptions of
        sense, was at last definitely cast aside as a delusion; what remained
        were the individual perceptions, admittedly separate, unreasoned,
        unrelated; Reason was dethroned, Chaos was king. In other words, what
        seemed to any individual sentient being at any moment to be, that for
        him was, and nothing else was. The distinction between the real and the
        apparent was definitely attempted to be abolished, not as hitherto by
        rejecting the sensually apparent in favour of the rationally conceived
        real, but by the denial of any such real altogether.
      </p>

      <p>
        The individualistic revolution in philosophy not only, however, had
        analogies with the similar revolution contemporaneously going on in
        Greek politics, it was greatly facilitated by it. Each, in short, acted
        and reacted on the other. Just as the sceptical philosophy of the
        Encyclopaedists in France promoted the Revolution, and the Revolution in
        its turn developed and confirmed the philosophic scepticism, so also the
        collapse of contending philosophies in Greece promoted the collapse of
        contending systems of political authority, and the collapse of political
        authority facilitated the growth of that individualism in thought with
        which the name of the Sophists is associated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cicero (Brut. 12) definitely connects the rise of these teachers with
        the expulsion of the tyrants and the establishment of democratic
        republics in Sicily. From 466 to 406 B.C. Syracuse was democratically
        governed, and a 'free career to talents,' as in revolutionary France, so
        also in revolutionary Greece, began to be promoted by the elaboration of
        a system of persuasive argument. Devices of method called 'commonplaces'
        were constructed, whereby, irrespective of the truth or falsehood of the
        subject-matter, a favourable vote in the public assemblies, a successful
        verdict in the public courts, might more readily be procured. Thus by
        skill of verbal rhetoric, the worse might be made to appear the better
        reason; and philosophy, so far as it continued its functions, became a
        search, not for the real amidst the confusions of the seeming and
        unreal, but a search for the seeming and the plausible, to the
        detriment, or at least to the ignoring, of any reality at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        The end of philosophy then was no longer universal truth, but individual
        success; and consistently enough, the philosopher himself professed the
        individualism of his own point of view, by teaching only those who were
        prepared to pay him for his teaching. All over Greece, with the growth
        of democracy, this philosophy of persuasion became popular; but it was
        to Athens, under Pericles at this time the centre of all that was most
        vivid and splendid in Greek life and thought, that the chief teachers of
        the new philosophy flocked from every part of the Greek world.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first great leader of the Sophists was Protagoras. He, it is said,
        was the first to teach for pay; he also was the first to adopt the name
        of Sophist. In the word Sophist there was indeed latent the idea which
        subsequently attached to it, but as first used it seems to have implied
        this only, that skill was the object of the teaching rather than truth;
        the new teachers professed themselves 'practical men,' not mere
        theorists.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Greek word, in short, meant an able cultivated man in any branch of
        the arts; and the development of practical capacity was doubtless what
        Protagoras intended to indicate as the purpose of his teaching, when he
        called himself a Sophist. But the ability he really undertook to
        cultivate was ability to persuade, for Greece at this time was nothing
        if not political; and persuasive oratory was the one road to political
        success. And as Athens was the great centre of Greek politics, as well
        as of Greek intellect, to Athens Protagoras came as a teacher.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was born at Abdera, in Thrace (birthplace also of Democritus), in 480
        B.C., began to teach at Athens about 451 B.C., and soon acquired great
        influence with Pericles, the distinguished leader of the Athenian
        democracy at this time. It is even alleged that when in 445 the
        Athenians were preparing to establish a colony at Thurii in Italy,
        Protagoras was requested to draw up a code of laws for the new state,
        and personally to superintend its execution.
      </p>

      <p>
        After spending some time in Italy he returned to Athens, and taught
        there with great success for a number of years. Afterwards he taught for
        some time in Sicily, and died at the age of seventy, after about forty
        years of professional activity. He does not seem to have contented
        himself with the merely practical task of teaching rhetoric, but in a
        work which he, perhaps ironically, entitled Truth, he enunciated the
        principles on which he based his teaching. Those principles were summed
        up in the sentence, "Man (by which he meant each man) is the measure of
        all things, whether of their existence when they do exist, or of their
        non-existence when they do not." In the development of this doctrine
        Protagoras starts from a somewhat similar analysis of things to that of
        Heraclitus and others. Everything is in continual flux, and the
        apparently real objects in nature are the mere temporary and illusory
        result of the in themselves invisible movements and minglings of the
        elements of which they are composed; and not only is it a delusion to
        attempt to give a factitious reality to the things which appear, it is
        equally a delusion to attempt to separate the (supposed) thing perceived
        from the perception itself. A thing is only as and when it is perceived.
        And a third delusion is to attempt to separate a supposed perceiving
        mind from the perception; all three exist only in and through the
        momentary perception; the supposed reality behind this, whether external
        in the object or internal in the mind, is a mere imagination. Thus the
        Heraclitean flux in Nature was extended to Mind also; only the sensation
        exists, and that only at the moment of its occurrence; this alone is
        truth, this alone is reality; all else is delusion.
      </p>

      <p>
        It followed from this that as a man felt a thing to be, so for him it
        veritably was. Thus abstract truth or falsity could not be; the same
        statements could be indifferently true or falseâ€”to different individuals
        at the same time, to the same individual at different times. It followed
        that all appearances were equally true: what seemed to be to any man,
        that was alone the true for him. The relation of such a doctrine as this
        to politics and to morals is not far to seek. Every man's opinion was as
        good as another's; if by persuasion you succeeded in altering a man's
        opinion, you had not deceived the man, his new opinion was as true (to
        him) as the old one. Persuasiveness, therefore, was the only wisdom.
        Thus if a man is ill what he eats and drinks seems bitter to him, and it
        is so; when he is well it seems the opposite, and is so. He is not a
        wiser man in the second state than in the first, but the second state is
        pleasanter. If then you can persuade him that what he thinks bitter is
        really sweet, you have done him good. This is what the physician tries
        to do by his drugs; this is what the Sophist tries to do by his words.
        Virtue then is teachable in so far as it is possible to persuade a boy
        or a man by rhetoric that that course of conduct which pleases others is
        a pleasant course for him. But if any one happens not to be persuaded of
        this, and continues to prefer his own particular course of conduct, this
        is for him the good course. You cannot blame him; you cannot say he is
        wrong. If you punish him you simply endeavour to supply the dose of
        unpleasantness which may be needed to put the balance in his case on the
        same side as it already occupies in the case of other people.
      </p>

      <p>
        It may be worth while to anticipate a little, and insert here in summary
        the refutation of this position put into the mouth of Socrates by Plato
        in the Theaetetus: "But I ought not to conceal from you that there is a
        serious objection which may be urged against this doctrine of
        Protagoras. For there are states, such as madness and dreaming, in which
        perception is false; and half our life is spent in dreaming; and who can
        say that at this instant we are not dreaming? Even the fancies of madmen
        are real at the time. But if knowledge is perception, how can we
        distinguish between the true and the false in such cases? . . . Shall I
        tell you what amazes me in your friend Protagoras? 'What may that be?' I
        like his doctrine that what appears is; but I wonder that he did not
        begin his great work on truth with a declaration that a pig, or a
        dog-faced baboon, or any other monster which has sensation, is a measure
        of all things; then while we were reverencing him as a god he might have
        produced a magnificent effect by expounding to us that he was no wiser
        than a tadpole. For if truth is only sensation, and one man's
        discernment is as good as another's, and every man is his own judge, and
        everything that he judges is right and true, then what need of
        Protagoras to be our instructor at a high figure; and why should we be
        less knowing than he is, or have to go to him, if every man is the
        measure of all things?" . . . Socrates now resumes the argument. As he
        is very desirous of doing justice to Protagoras, he insists on citing
        his own words: 'What appears to each man is to him.' "And how," asks
        Socrates, "are these words reconcilable with the fact that all mankind
        are agreed in thinking themselves wiser than others in some respects,
        and inferior to them in others? In the hour of danger they are ready to
        fall down and worship any one who is their superior in wisdom as if he
        were a god. And the world is full of men who are asking to be taught and
        willing to be ruled, and of other men who are willing to rule and teach
        them. All which implies that men do judge of one another's impressions,
        and think some wise and others foolish. How will Protagoras answer this
        argument? For he cannot say that no one deems another ignorant or
        mistaken. If you form a judgment, thousands and tens of thousands are
        ready to maintain the opposite. The multitude may not and do not agree
        in Protagoras' own thesis, 'that man is the measure of all things,' and
        then who is to decide? Upon hip own showing must not his 'truth' depend
        on the number of suffrages, and be more or less true in proportion as he
        has more or fewer of them? And (the majority being against him) he will
        be bound to acknowledge that they speak truly who deny him to speak
        truly, which is a famous jest. And if he admits that they speak truly
        who deny him to speak truly, he must admit that he himself does not
        speak truly. But his opponents will refuse to admit this as regards
        themselves, and he must admit that they are right in their refusal. The
        conclusion is, that all mankind, including Protagoras himself, will deny
        that he speaks truly; and his truth will be true neither to himself nor
        to anybody else" (Jowett, Plato, iv. pp. 239 sqq.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The refutation seems tolerably complete, but a good deal had to happen
        before Greece was ready to accept or Plato to offer such a refutation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gorgias was perhaps even more eminent a Sophist than Protagoras. He was
        a native of Leontini in Sicily, and came to Athens in the year 427 B.C.
        on a public embassy from his native city. The splendid reputation for
        political and rhetorical ability, which preceded him to Athens, he fully
        justified both by his public appearances before the Athenian assembly,
        and by the success of his private instructions to the crowds of wealthy
        young men who resorted to him. He dressed in magnificent style, and
        affected a lofty and poetical manner of speech, which offended the more
        critical, but which pleased the crowd.
      </p>

      <p>
        He also, like Protagoras, published a treatise in which he expounded his
        fundamental principles, and like Protagoras, he preceded it with a
        striking if somewhat ironical title, and an apophthegm in which he
        summarised his doctrine. The title of his work was Of the Non-Existent,
        that is, Of Nature, and his dictum, "Nothing exists, or if anything
        exists, it cannot be apprehended by man, and even if it could be
        apprehended, the man who apprehended it could not expound or explain it
        to his neighbour." In support of this strange doctrine, Gorgias adopted
        the quibbling method of argument which had been applied with some
        success to dialectical purposes by Zeno, Melissus, and others (see
        above, pp. 44 sqq.)
      </p>

      <p>
        His chief argument to prove the first position laid down by him depended
        on a double and ambiguous use of the word is; "That which is not, is the
        non-existent: the word is must, therefore, be applicable to it as truly
        as when we say That which is, is; therefore, being is predicable of that
        which is not." So conversely he proved not-being to be predicable of
        that which is. And in like manner he made away with any possible
        assertions as to the finite or infinite, the eternal or created, nature
        of that which is. Logic could supply him with alternative arguments from
        whatever point he started, such as would seem to land the question in
        absurdity. Hence his first position was (he claimed) established, that
        'Nothing is.'
      </p>

      <p>
        To prove the second, that even if anything is, it cannot be known to
        man, he argued thus: "If what a man thinks is not identical with what
        is, plainly what is cannot be thought. And that what a man thinks is not
        identical with what is can be shown from the fact that thinking does not
        affect the facts. You may imagine a man flying, or a chariot coursing
        over the deep, but you do not find these things to occur because you
        imagine them. Again, if we assume that what we think is identical with
        what is, then it must be impossible to think of what is not. But this is
        absurd; for we can think of such admittedly imaginary beings as Scylla
        and Chimaera, and multitudes of others. There is therefore no necessary
        relation between our thoughts and any realities; we may believe, but we
        cannot prove, which (if any) of our conceptions have relation to an
        external fact and which have not."
      </p>

      <p>
        Nor thirdly, supposing any man had obtained an apprehension of what is
        real, could he possibly communicate it to any one else. If a man saw
        anything, he could not possibly by verbal description make clear what it
        is he sees to a man who has never seen. And so if a man has not himself
        the apprehension of reality, mere words from another cannot possibly
        give him any idea of it. He may imagine he has the same idea as the
        speaker, but where is he going to get the common test by which to
        establish the identity?
      </p>

      <p>
        Without attempting to follow Gorgias further, we can see plainly enough
        the object and purport of the whole doctrine. Its main result is to
        isolate. It isolates each man from his fellows; he cannot tell what they
        know or think, they cannot reach any common ground with him. It isolates
        him from nature; he cannot tell what nature is, he cannot tell whether
        he knows anything of nature or reality at all. It isolates him from
        himself; he cannot tell for certain what relation exists (if any)
        between what he imagines he perceives at any moment and any remembered
        or imagined previous experiences; he cannot be sure that there ever were
        any such experiences, or what that self was (if anything) which had
        them, or whether there was or is any self perceiving anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us imagine the moral effect on the minds of the ablest youth of
        Greece of such an absolute collapse of belief. The philosophic
        scepticism did not deprive them of their appetites or passions; it did
        not in the least alter their estimate of the prizes of success, or the
        desirability of wealth and power. All it did was to shatter the
        invisible social bonds of reverence and honour and truth and justice,
        which in greater or less degree act as a restraining force upon the
        purely selfish appetites of men. Not only belief in divine government
        disappeared, but belief in any government external or internal; justice
        became a cheating device to deprive a man of what was ready to his
        grasp; good-faith was stupidity when it was not a more subtle form of
        deceit; morality was at best a mere convention which a man might cancel
        if he pleased; the one reality was the appetite of the moment, the one
        thing needful its gratification; society, therefore, was universal war,
        only with subtler weapons.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course Protagoras and Gorgias were only notable types of a whole
        horde of able men who in various ways, and with probably less clear
        notions than these men of the drift or philosophic significance of their
        activity, helped all over Greece in the promulgation of this new gospel
        of self-interest. Many Sophists no doubt troubled themselves very little
        with philosophical questions; they were 'agnostics,' know-nothings; all
        they professed to do was to teach some practical skill of a verbal or
        rhetorical character. They had nothing to do with the nature or value of
        ideals; they did not profess to say whether any end or aim was in itself
        good or bad, but given an end or aim, they were prepared to help those
        who hired them to acquire a skill which would be useful towards
        attaining it.
      </p>

      <p>
        But whether a philosophy or ultimate theory of life be expressly stated
        or realised by a nation or an individual, or be simply ignored by them,
        there always is some such philosophy or theory underlying their action,
        and that philosophy or theory tends to work itself out to its logical
        issue in action, whether men openly profess it or no. And the theory of
        negation of law in nature or in man which underlay the sophistic
        practice had its logical and necessary effect on the social structure
        throughout Greece, in a loosening of the bonds of religion, of family
        reverence and affection, of patriotism, of law, of honour. Thucydides in
        a well-known passage (iii. 82) thus describes the prevalent condition of
        thought in his own time, which was distinctively that of the sophistic
        teaching: "The common meaning of words was turned about at men's
        pleasure; the most reckless bravo was deemed the most desirable friend;
        a man of prudence and moderation was styled a coward; a man who listened
        to reason was a good-for-nothing simpleton. People were trusted exactly
        in proportion to their violence and unscrupulousness, and no one was so
        popular as the successful conspirator, except perhaps one who had been
        clever enough to outwit him at his own trade, but any one who honestly
        attempted to remove the causes of such treacheries was considered a
        traitor to his party. As for oaths, no one imagined they were to be kept
        a moment longer than occasion required; it was, in fact, an added
        pleasure to destroy your enemy if you had managed to catch him through
        his trusting to your word."
      </p>

      <p>
        These are the words not of Plato, who is supposed often enough to allow
        his imagination to carry him beyond his facts about the Sophists as
        about others, nor are they the words of a satiric poet such as
        Aristophanes. They are the words of the most sober and philosophic of
        Greek historians, and they illustrate very strikingly the tendency, nay,
        the absolute necessity, whereby the theories of philosophers in the
        closet extend themselves into the market-place and the home, and find an
        ultimate realisation of themselves for good or for evil in the 'business
        and bosoms' of the common crowd.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is not to be said that the individualistic and iconoclastic movement
        which the Sophists represented was wholly bad, or wholly unnecessary,
        any more (to again quote a modern instance) than that the French
        Revolution was. There was much, no doubt, in the traditional religion
        and morality of Greece at that time which represented obsolete and
        antiquated conditions, when every city lived apart from its neighbours
        with its own narrow interests and local cults and ceremonials. Greece
        was ceasing to be an unconnected crowd of little separate communities;
        unconsciously it was preparing itself for a larger destiny, that of
        conqueror and civiliser of East and West. This scepticism, utterly
        untenable and unworkable on the lines extravagantly laid down by its
        leading teachers, represented the birth of new conditions of thought and
        action adapted to the new conditions of things. On the surface, and
        accepted literally, it seemed to deny the possibility of knowledge; it
        threatened to destroy humanity and civilisation. But its strength lay
        latent in an implied denial only of what was merely traditional; it
        denied the finality of purely Greek preconceptions; it was laying the
        foundations of a broader humanity. It represented the claim of a new
        generation to have no dogma or assumption thrust on it by mere force,
        physical or moral. "I too am a man," it said; "I have rights; my reason
        must be convinced." This is the fundamental thought at the root of most
        revolutions and reformations and revivals, and the thought is therefore
        a necessary and a just one.

        Unfortunately it seems to be an inevitable condition of human affairs
        that nothing new, however necessary or good can come into being out of
        the old, without much sorrow and many a birth-pang. The extravagant, the
        impetuous, the narrow-minded on both sides seize on their points of
        difference, raise them into battle-cries, and make what might be a
        peaceful regeneration a horrid battlefield of contending hates. The
        Christ when He comes brings not peace into the world, but a sword. And
        men of evil passions and selfish ambitions are quick on both sides to
        make the struggle of old and new ideals a handle for their own
        indulgence or their own advancement; the Pharisees and the Judases
        between them make the Advent in some of its aspects a sorry spectacle.

        A reconciler was wanted who should wed what was true in the new doctrine
        of individualism with what was valuable in the old doctrine of universal
        and necessary truth; who should be able to say, "Yes, I acknowledge that
        your individual view of things must be reckoned with, and mine, and
        everybody else's; and for that very reason do I argue for a universal
        and necessary truth, because the very truth for you as an individual is
        just this universal." The union and identification of the Individual and
        Universal,â€”this paradox of philosophy is the doctrine of Socrates.
