        <a href="school-of-miletus.html"><strong>School of Miletus</strong></a>
        For several centuries prior to the great Persian invasions of Greece,
        perhaps the very greatest and wealthiest city of the Greek world was
        Miletus. Situate about the centre of the Ionian coasts of Asia Minor,
        with four magnificent harbours and a strongly defensible position, it
        gathered to itself much of the great overland trade, which has flowed
        for thousands of years eastward and westward between India and the
        Mediterranean; while by its great fleets it created a new world of its
        own along the Black Sea coast.

        <a href="stoics.html"><strong>Stoics</strong></a>
        Zeno, the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy (born circa 340
        B.C.), was a native of Citium in Cyprus. The city was Greek, but with a
        large Phoenician admixture. And it is curious that in this last and
        sternest phase of Greek thought, not the founder only, but a large
        proportion of the successive leaders of the school, came from this and
        other places having Semitic elements in them.

        The first phase of the change, Scepticism, or Pyrrhonism, as it was
        named from its first teacher, need not detain us long. Pyrrho was priest
        of Elis; in earlier life he accompanied Alexander the Great as far as
        India, and is said to have become acquainted with certain of the
        philosophic sects in that country.

        <a href="sophists.html"><strong>Sophists</strong></a>
        A certain analogy may perhaps be discerned between the progression of
        philosophic thought in Greece as we have traced it, and the political
        development which had its course in almost every Greek state during the
        same period. The Ionic philosophy may be regarded as corresponding with
        the kingly era in Greek politics. Philosophy sits upon the heights and
        utters its authoritative dicta for the resolution of the seeming
        contradictions of things.

        <a href="lycurgus.html"><strong>Lycurgus</strong></a>
        There is so much uncertainty in the accounts which historians have left
        us of Lycurgus, the lawgiver of Sparta, that scarcely anything is
        asserted by one of them which is not called into question or
        contradicted by the rest. Their sentiments are quite different as to the
        family he came of, the voyages he undertook, the place and manner of his
        death, but most of all when they speak of the laws he made and the
        commonwealth which he founded.

        We have now before us the main facts with regard to the Stoic view of
        man's nature, but we have yet to see in what setting they were put. What
        was the Stoic outlook upon the universe? The answer to this question is
        supplied by their Physic.

        <a href="ethic.html"><strong>Ethic</strong></a>
        We have already had to touch upon the psychology of the Stoics in
        connection with the first principles of logic. It is no less necessary
        to do so now in dealing with the foundation of ethic.

        <a href="logic.html"><strong>Logic</strong></a>
        The Stoics had a tremendous reputation for logic. In this department
        they were the successors or rather the supersessors of Aristotle.

          ><strong>Division of Philosophy</strong></a
        >
        Philosophy was defined by the Stoics as 'the knowledge of things divine
        and human'. It was divided into three departments; logic, ethic, and
        physic. This division indeed was in existence before their time, but
        they have got the credit of it as of some other things which they did
        not originate.

        Among the Greeks and Romans of the classical age philosophy occupied the
        place taken by religion among ourselves. Their appeal was to reason not
        to revelation.
