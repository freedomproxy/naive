      <h1>Physic</h1>

      <p>
        We have now before us the main facts with regard to the Stoic view of
        man's nature, but we have yet to see in what setting they were put. What
        was the Stoic outlook upon the universe? The answer to this question is
        supplied by their Physic.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were, according to the Stoics, two first principles of all things,
        the active and the passive. The passive was that unqualified being which
        is known as Matter. The active was the Logos, or reason in it, which is
        God. This, it was held, eternally pervades matter and creates all
        things. This dogma, laid down by Zeno, was repeated after him by the
        subsequent heads of the school.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were then two first principles, but there were not two causes of
        things. The active principle alone was cause, the other was mere
        material for it to work on—inert, senseless, destitute in itself of all
        shape and qualities, but ready to assume any qualities or shape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Matter was defined as that out of which anything is produced. The Prime
        Matter, or unqualified being, was eternal and did not admit of increase
        or decrease, but only of change. It was the substance or being of all
        things that are.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Stoics, it will be observed, used the term "matter" with the same
        confusing ambiguity with which we use it ourselves, now for sensible
        objects which have shape and other qualities, now for the abstract
        conception of matter, which is devoid of all qualities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both these first principles, it must be understood, were conceived of as
        bodies, though without form, the one everywhere interpenetrating the
        other. To say that the passive principle, or matter, is a body comes
        easy to us, because of the familiar confusion adverted to above. But how
        could the active principle, or God, be conceived of as a body? The
        answer to this question may sound paradoxical. It is because God is a
        spirit. A spirit in its original sense meant air in motion. Now the
        active principle was not air, but it was something which bore an analogy
        to it—namely aether. Aether in motion might be called a 'spirit' as well
        as air in motion. It was in this sense that Chrysippus defined the thing
        that is, to be a spirit moving itself into and out of itself, or spirit
        moving itself to and fro.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the two first principles which are ungenerated and indestructible
        must be distinguished the four elements which, though ultimate for us,
        yet were produced in the beginning by God and are destined some day to
        be reabsorbed into the divine nature. These with the Stoics were the
        same which had been accepted since Empedocles—namely earth, air, fire
        and water. The elements, like the two first principles were bodies;
        unlike them, they were declared to have shape as well as extension.
      </p>

      <p>
        An element was defined as that out of which things at first come into
        being and into which they are at last resolved. In this relation did the
        four elements stand to all the compound bodies which the universe
        contained. The terms earth, air, fire and water had to be taken in a
        wide sense: earth meaning all that was of the nature of earth, air all
        that was of the nature of air and so on. Thus, in the human frame, the
        bones and sinews pertained to earth.
      </p>

      <p>
        The four qualities of matter—hot, cold, moist and dry—were indicative of
        the presence of the four elements. Fire was the source of heat, air of
        cold, water of moisture, and earth of dryness. Between them, the four
        elements made up the unqualified being called Matter. All animals and
        other compound natures on earth had in them representatives of the four
        great physical constituents of the universe, but the moon, according to
        Chrysippus, consisted only of fire and air, while the sun was pure fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        While all compound bodies were resolvable into the four elements, there
        were important differences among the elements, themselves. Two of them,
        fire and air, were light; the other two, water and earth, were heavy. By
        'light' was meant that which tends away from its own centre, by 'heavy,'
        that which, tends towards it. The two light elements stood to the two
        heavy ones in much the same relation as the active to the passive
        principle generally. But further, fire had such a primary as entitles
        it, if the definition of element were pressed, to be considered alone
        worthy of the name. For the three other elements arose out of it and
        were to be again resolved into it.
      </p>

      <p>
        We should obtain a wholly wrong impression of what Bishop Berkeley calls
        'the philosophy of fire' if we set before our minds in this connection,
        the raging element whose strength is in destruction. Let us rather
        picture to ourselves as the type of fire the benign and beatific solar
        heat, the quickener and fosterer of all terrestrial life. For according
        to Zeno, there were two kinds of fire, the one destructive, the other
        what we may call 'constructive,' and which he called 'artistic'. This
        latter kind of fire, which was known as aether, was the substance of the
        heavenly bodies, as it was also of the soul of animals and of the
        'nature' of plants. Chrysippus, following Heraclitus, taught that the
        elements passed into one another by a process of condensation and
        rarefaction. Fire first became solidified into air, then air into water
        and lastly water into earth. The process of dissolution took place in
        the reverse order, earth being rarefied into water, water into air, and
        air into fire. It is allowable to see in this old world doctrine an
        anticipation of the modern idea of different states of matter—the solid,
        the liquid, and the gaseous, with a fourth beyond the gaseous which
        science can still only guess at, and in which matter seems almost to
        merge into spirit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each of the four elements had its own abode in the universe. Outermost
        of all was the ethereal 'fire' which was divided into two spheres: first
        that of the fixed stars and next that of the planets. Below this lay the
        sphere of 'air', below this again that of 'water', and lowest or in
        other words, most central of all was the sphere of 'earth', the solid
        foundation of the whole structure. Water might be said to be above earth
        because nowhere was there water to be found without earth beneath it,
        but the surface of water was always equidistant from the centre, whereas
        earth had prominences which rose above water.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we say that the Stoics regarded the universe as a plenum, the
        reader must understand by 'the universe' the Cosmos or ordered whole.
        Within this there was no emptiness owing to the pressure of the
        celestial upon the terrestrial sphere. But outside of this lay the
        infinite void without beginning, middle, or end. This occupied a very
        ambiguous position In their scheme. It was not being, for being was
        confined to body and yet it was there. It was in fact nothing, and that
        was why it was infinite. For as nothing cannot be bound to any thing, so
        neither can there be any bound to nothing. But while bodiless itself, it
        had the capacity to contain body, a fact which enabled it, despite its
        non-entity, to serve, as we shall see, a useful purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Did the Stoics then regard the universe as finite or as infinite? In
        answering this question we must distinguish our terms, as they did. The
        All, they said, was infinite, but the Whole was finite. For the 'All'
        was the cosmos and the void, whereas the 'Whole' was the cosmos only.
        This distinction we may suppose to have originated with the later
        members of the school. For Appolodorus noted the ambiguity of the word
        'All' as meaning,
      </p>

      <p>
        (1) the cosmos only,<br />
        (2) cosmos + void
      </p>

      <p>
        If then by the term "universe" we understand the cosmos, or ordered
        whole, we must say that the Stoics regarded the universe as finite. All
        being and all body, which was the same thing with being, had necessarily
        bounds, it was only not being, which was boundless.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another distinction, due this time to Chrysippus himself, which the
        Stoics found it convenient to draw, was between the three words 'void,'
        'place' and 'space'. Void was defined as 'the absence of body', place
        was that which was occupied by body, the term 'space' was reserved for
        that which was partly occupied and partly unoccupied. As there was no
        corner of the cosmos unfilled by body, space, it will be seen, was
        another name for the All. Place was compared to a vessel that was full,
        void to one that was empty, and space to the vast wine-cask, such as
        that in which Diogenes made his home, which was kept partly fully, but
        in which there was always room for more. The last comparison must of
        course not be pressed. For if space be a cask, it is one without top,
        bottom or sides.
      </p>

      <p>
        But while the Stoics regarded our universe as an island of being in an
        ocean of void, they did not admit the possibility that other such
        islands might exist beyond our ken. The spectacle of the starry heavens,
        which presented itself nightly to their gaze in all the brilliancy of a
        southern sky—that was all there was of being, beyond that lay
        nothingness. Democritus or the Epicureans might dream of other worlds,
        but the Stoics contended for the unity of the cosmos as staunchly as the
        Mahometans for the unity of God, for with them the cosmos was God.
      </p>

      <p>
        In shape they conceived of it as spherical, on the ground that the
        sphere was the perfect figure and was also the best adapted for motion.
        Not that the universe as a whole moved. The earth lay in its centre,
        spherical and motionless, and round it coursed the sun, moon, and
        planets, fixed each in its respective sphere as in so many concentric
        rings, while the outermost ring of all, which contained the fixed stars,
        wheeled round the rest with an inconceivable velocity.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tendency of all things in the universe to the centre kept the earth
        fixed in the middle as being subject to an equal pressure on every side.
        The same cause also, according to Zeno, kept the universe itself at rest
        in the void. But in an infinite void, it could make no difference
        whether the whole were at rest or in motion. It may have been a desire
        to escape the notion of a migratory whole which led Zeno to broach the
        curious doctrine that the universe has no weight, as being composed of
        elements whereof two are heavy and two are light. Air and fire did
        indeed tend to the centre like everything else in the cosmos, but not
        till they had reached their natural home. Till then they were of an
        upward-growing nature. It appears then that the upward and downward
        tendencies of the elements were held to neutralise one another and to
        leave the universe devoid of weight.
      </p>

      <p>
        The universe was the only thing which was perfect in itself, the one
        thing which was an end in itself. All other things were perfect indeed
        as parts, when considered with reference to the whole, but were none of
        them ends in themselves, unless man could be deemed so who was born to
        contemplate the universe and imitate its perfections. Thus, then, did
        the Stoics envisage the universe on its physical side—as one, finite,
        fixed in space, but revolving round its own centre, earth, beautiful
        beyond all things, and perfect as a whole.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it was impossible for this order and beauty to exist without mind.
        The universe was pervaded by intelligence as man's body is pervaded by
        his soul. But as the human soul though everywhere present in the body is
        not present everywhere in the same degree, so it was with the
        world-soul. The human soul presents itself not only as intellect, but
        also in the lower manifestations of sense, growth, and cohesion. It is
        the soul which is the cause of the plant life, which displays itself
        more particularly in the nails and hair; it is the soul also which
        causes cohesion among the parts of the solid substances such as bones
        and sinews, that make up our frame. In the same way the world-soul
        displayed itself in rational beings as intellect, in the lower animals
        as mere souls, in plants as nature or growth, and in inorganic
        substances as 'holding' or cohesion. To this lowest stage add change,
        and you have growth or plant nature; super-add to this phantasy and
        impulse and you rise to the soul of irrational animals; at a yet higher
        stage you reach the rational and discursive intellect, which is peculiar
        to man among mortal natures.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have spoken of soul as the cause of the plant life in our bodies, but
        plants were not admitted by the Stoics to be possessed of soul in the
        strict sense. What animated them was 'nature' or, as we have called it
        above, 'growth'. Nature, in this sense of the principle of growth, was
        defined by the Stoics as 'a constructive fire, proceeding in a regular
        way to production,' or 'a fiery spirit endowed with artistic skill'.
        That Nature was an artist needed no proof, since it was her handiwork
        that human art essayed to copy. But she was an artist who combined the
        useful with the pleasant, aiming at once at beauty and convenience. In
        the widest sense, Nature was another name for Providence, or the
        principle which held the universe together, but, as the term is now
        being employed, it stood for that degree of existence which is above
        cohesion and below soul. From this point of view, it was defined as "a
        cohesion subject to self originated change in accordance with seminal
        reasons effecting and maintaining its results in definite times, and
        reproducing in the offspring the characteristics of the parent". This
        sounds about as abstract as Herbert Spencer's definition of life, but it
        must be borne in mind that nature was all the time a 'spirit', and as
        such a body. It was a body of a less subtle essence than soul.
        Similarly, when the Stoics spoke of cohesion, they are not to be taken
        as referring to some abstract principle like attraction. 'Cohesions,'
        said Chrysippus, 'are nothing else than airs, for it is by these that
        bodies are held together, and of the individual qualities of things
        which are held together by cohesion, it is the air which is the
        compressing cause which in iron is called "hardness", in stone
        "thickness" and in solver "whiteness"'. Not only solidarity then, but
        also colours, which Zeno called 'the first schematisms' of matter were
        regarded as due to the mysterious agency of air. In fact, qualities in
        general were but blasts and tensions of the air, which gave form and
        figure to the inert matter underlying them.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the man is in one sense the soul, in another the body, and in a third
        the union of both, so it was with the cosmos. The word was used in three
        senses—
      </p>

      <p>
        (1) God<br />
        (2) the arrangement of the stars, etc.<br />
        (3) the combination of both.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cosmos as identical with God was described as an individual made up
        of all being who is incorruptible and ungenerated, the fashioner of the
        ordered frame of the universe, who at certain periods of time absorbs
        all being into himself and again generates it from himself. Thus the
        cosmos on its external side was doomed to perish and the mode of its
        destruction was to be by fire, a doctrine which has been stamped upon
        the world's belief down to the present day. What was to bring about this
        consummation was the soul of the universe becoming too big for its body,
        which it would eventually swallow up altogether. In the efflagration,
        when everything went back to the primeval aether, the universe would be
        pure soul and alive equally through and through. In this subtle and
        attenuated state, it would require more room than before and so expand
        into the void, contracting again when another period of cosmic
        generation had set in. Hence the Stoic definition of the Void or
        Infinite as that into which the cosmos is resolved at the efflagration.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this theory of the contraction of the universe out of an ethereal
        state and ultimate return to the same condition one sees a resemblance
        to the modern scientific hypothesis of the origin of our planetary
        system out of the solar nebula, and its predestined end in the same.
        Especially is this the case with the form in which the theory was held
        by Cleanthes, who pictured the heavenly bodies as hastening to their own
        destruction by dashing themselves, like so many gigantic moths, into the
        sun. Cleanthes however did not conceive mere mechanical force to be at
        work in this matter. The grand apotheosis of suicide which he foresaw
        was a voluntary act; for the heavenly bodies were Gods and were willing
        to lose their own in a larger life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus all the deities except Zeus were mortal, or at all events,
        perishable. Gods, like men, were destined to have an end some day. They
        would melt in the great furnace of being as though they were made of wax
        or tin. Zeus then would be left alone with his own thoughts, or as the
        Stoics sometimes put it, Zeus would fall back upon Providence. For by
        Providence they meant the leading principle or mind of the whole, and by
        Zeus, as distinguished from Providence, this mind together with the
        cosmos, which was to it as body. In the efflagration the two would be
        fused into one in the single substance of aether. And then in the
        fulness of time there would be a restitution of all things. Everything
        would come round regularly again exactly as it had been before.
      </p>

      <p>
        To us who have been taught to pant for progress, this seems a dreary
        prospect. But the Stoics were consistent Optimists, and did not ask for
        a change in what was best. They were content that the one drama of
        existence should enjoy a perpetual run without perhaps too nice a
        consideration for the actors. Death intermitted life, but did not end
        it. For the candle of life, which was extinguished now, would be kindled
        again hereafter. Being and not being came round in endless succession
        for all save him, into whom all being was resolved, and out of whom it
        emerged again, as from the vortex of some aeonian Maelstrom.
