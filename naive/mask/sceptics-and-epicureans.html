      <h1>Sceptics and Epicureans</h1>

      <p>
        Philosophy, equally complete, equally perfect in all its parts, had its
        final word in Plato and Aristotle; on the great lines of universal
        knowledge no further really original structures were destined to be
        raised by Greek hands. We have seen a parallelism between Greek
        philosophy and Greek politics in their earlier phases (see above, p.
        82); the same parallelism continues to the end. Greece broke the bonds
        of her intense but narrow civic life and civic thought, and spread
        herself out over the world in a universal monarchy and a cosmopolitan
        philosophy; but with this widening of the area of her influence reaction
        came and disruption and decay; an immense stimulus was given on the one
        hand to the political activity, on the other, to the thought and
        knowledge of the world as a whole, but at the centre Greece was 'living
        Greece no more,' her politics sank to the level of a dreary farce, her
        philosophy died down to a dull and spiritless scepticism, to an
        Epicureanism that 'seasoned the wine-cup with the dust of death,' or to
        a Stoicism not undignified yet still sad and narrow and stern. The hope
        of the world, alike in politics and in philosophy, faded as the life of
        Greece decayed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first phase of the change, Scepticism, or Pyrrhonism, as it was
        named from its first teacher, need not detain us long. Pyrrho was priest
        of Elis; in earlier life he accompanied Alexander the Great as far as
        India, and is said to have become acquainted with certain of the
        philosophic sects in that country. In his sceptical doctrine he had,
        like his predecessors, a school with its succession of teachers; but the
        world has remembered little more of him or them than two phrases
        'suspense of judgment'—this for the intellectual side of philosophy;
        'impassibility'—this for the moral. The doctrine is a negation of
        doctrine, the idle dream of idle men; even Pyrrho once, when surprised
        in some sudden access of fear, confessed that it was hard for him 'to
        get rid of the man in himself.' Vigorous men and growing nations are
        never agnostic. They decline to rest in mere suspense; they are
        extremely the opposite of impassive; they believe earnestly, they feel
        strongly.
      </p>

      <p>
        A more interesting, because more positive and constructive, personality
        was that of Epicurus. This philosopher was born at Samos, in the year
        341 B.C., of Athenian parents. He came to Athens in his eighteenth year.
        Xenocrates was then teaching at the Academy, Aristotle at the Lyceum,
        but Epicurus heard neither the one nor the other. After some wanderings
        he returned to Athens and set up on his own account as a teacher of
        philosophy. He made it a matter of boasting that he was a self-taught
        philosopher; and Cicero (De Nat. Deor. i. 26) sarcastically remarks that
        one could have guessed as much, even if Epicurus had not stated it
        himself; as one might of the proprietor of an ugly house, who should
        boast that he had employed no architect. The style of Epicurus was, in
        fact, plain and unadorned, but he seems all the same to have been able
        to say what he meant; and few if any writers ancient or modern have ever
        had so splendid a literary tribute, as Epicurus had from the great Roman
        poet Lucretius, his follower and expositor.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Glory of the Greek race," he says, "who first hadst power to raise high
        so bright a light in the midst of darkness so profound, shedding a beam
        on all the interests of life, thee do I follow, and in the markings of
        thy track do I set my footsteps now. Not that I desire to rival thee,
        but rather for love of thee would fain call myself thy disciple. For how
        shall the swallow rival the swan, or what speed may the kid with its
        tottering limbs attain, compared with the brave might of the scampering
        steed? Thou; O father, art the discoverer of nature, thou suppliest to
        us a father's teachings, and from thy pages, illustrious one, even as
        bees sip all manner of sweets along the flowery glades, we in like
        manner devour all thy golden words, golden and right worthy to live for
        ever. For soon as thy philosophy, birth of thy godlike mind, hath begun
        to declare the origin of things, straightway the terrors of the soul are
        scattered, earth's walls are broken apart, and through all the void I
        see nature in the working. I behold the gods in manifestation of their
        power, I discern their blissful seats, which never winds assail nor
        rain-clouds sprinkle with their showers, nor snow falling white with
        hoary frost doth buffet, but cloudless aether ever wraps them round,
        beaming in broad diffusion of glorious light. For nature supplies their
        every want nor aught impairs their peace of soul. But nowhere do I see
        any regions of hellish darkness, nor does the earth impose a barrier to
        our sight of what is done in the void beneath our feet. Wherefore a holy
        ecstasy and thrill of awe possess me, while thus by thy power the
        secrets of nature are disclosed to view" (Lucret. De Nat. Rer. iii,
        1-30).
      </p>

      <p>
        This devotion to the memory of Epicurus on the part of Lucretius was
        paralleled by the love felt for him by his contemporaries; he had crowds
        of followers who loved him and who were proud to learn his words by
        heart. He seems indeed to have been a man of exceptional kindness and
        amiability, and the 'garden of Epicurus' became proverbial as a place of
        temperate pleasures and wise delights. Personally we may take it that
        Epicurus was a man of simple tastes and moderate desires; and indeed
        throughout its history Epicureanism as a rule of conduct has generally
        been associated with the finer forms of enjoyment, rather than the more
        sensual. The 'sensual sty' is a nickname, not a description.
      </p>

      <p>
        Philosophy Epicurus defined as a process of thought and reasoning
        tending to the realisation of happiness. Arts or sciences which had no
        such practical end he contemned; and, as will be observed in Lucretius'
        praises of him above, even physics had but one purpose or interest, to
        free the soul from terrors of the unseen. Thus philosophy was mainly
        concerned with conduct, i.e. with Ethics, but secondarily and negatively
        with Physics, to which was appended what Epicurus called Canonics, or
        the science of testing, that is, a kind of logic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beginning with Canonics, as the first part of philosophy in order of
        time, from the point of view of human knowledge, Epicurus laid it down
        that the only source of knowledge was the senses, which gave us an
        immediate and true perception of that which actually came into contact
        with them. Even the visions of madmen or of dreamers he considered were
        in themselves true, being produced by a physical cause of some kind, of
        which these visions were the direct and immediate report. Falsity came
        in with people's interpretations or imaginations with respect to these
        sensations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sensations leave a trace in the memory, and out of similarities or
        analogies among sensations there are developed in the mind general
        notions or types, such as 'man,' 'house,' which are also true, because
        they are reproductions of sensations. Thirdly, when a sensation occurs,
        it is brought into relation in the mind with one or more of these types
        or notions; this is predication, true also in so far as its elements are
        true, but capable of falsehood, as subsequent or independent sensation
        may prove. If supported or not contradicted by sensation, it is or may
        be true; if contradicted or not supported by sensation, it is or may be
        false. The importance of this statement of the canon of truth or
        falsehood will be understood when we come to the physics of Epicurus, at
        the basis of which is his theory of Atoms, which by their very nature
        can never be directly testified to by sensation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This and no more was what Epicurus had to teach on the subject of logic.
        He had no theory of definition, or division, or ratiocination, or
        refutation, or explication; on all these matters Epicurus was, as Cicero
        said, 'naked and unarmed.' Like most self-taught or ill-taught teachers,
        Epicurus trusted to his dogmas; he knew nothing and cared nothing for
        logical defence.
      </p>

      <p>
        In his Physics Epicurus did little more than reproduce the doctrine of
        Democritus. He starts from the fundamental proposition that 'nothing can
        be produced from nothing, nothing can really perish.' The veritable
        existences in nature are the Atoms, which are too minute to be
        discernible by the senses, but which nevertheless have a definite size,
        and cannot further be divided. They have also a definite weight and
        form, but no qualities other than these. There is an infinity of empty
        space; this Epicurus proves on abstract grounds, practically because a
        limit to space is unthinkable. It follows that there must be an infinite
        number of the atoms, otherwise they would disperse throughout the
        infinite void and disappear. There is a limit, however, to the number of
        varieties among the atoms in respect of form, size, and weight. The
        existence of the void space is proved by the fact that motion takes
        place, to which he adds the argument that it necessarily exists also to
        separate the atoms one from another. So far Epicurus and Democritus are
        agreed.
      </p>

      <p>
        To the Democritean doctrine, however, Epicurus made a curious addition,
        to which he himself is said to have attached much importance. The
        natural course (he said) for all bodies having weight is downwards in a
        straight line. It struck Epicurus that this being so, the atoms would
        all travel for ever in parallel lines, and those 'clashings and
        interminglings' of atoms out of which he conceived all visible forms to
        be produced, could never occur. He therefore laid it down that the atoms
        deviated the least little bit from the straight, thus making a world
        possible. And Epicurus considered that this supposed deviation of the
        atoms not only made a world possible, but human freedom also. In the
        deviation, without apparent cause, of the descending atoms, the law of
        necessity was broken, and there was room on the one hand for man's free
        will, on the other, for prayer to the gods, and for hope of their
        interference on our behalf.
      </p>

      <p>
        It may be worth while summarising the proofs which Lucretius in his
        great poem, professedly following in the footsteps of Epicurus, adduces
        for these various doctrines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Epicurus' first dogma is, 'Nothing proceeds from nothing,' that is,
        every material object has some matter previously existing exactly equal
        in quantity to it, out of which it was made. To prove this Lucretius
        appeals to the order of nature as seen in the seasons, in the phenomena
        of growth, in the fixed relations which exist between life and its
        environment as regards what is helpful or harmful, in the limitation of
        size and of faculties in the several species and the fixity of the
        characteristics generally in each, in the possibilities of cultivation
        and improvement of species within certain limits and under certain
        conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        To prove his second position, 'Nothing passes into nothing,' Lucretius
        points out to begin with that there is a law even in destruction; force
        is required to dissolve or dismember anything; were it otherwise the
        world would have disappeared long ago. Moreover, he points out that it
        is from the elements set free by decay and death that new things are
        built up; there is no waste, no visible lessening of the resources of
        nature, whether in the generations of living things, in the flow of
        streams and the fulness of ocean, or in the eternal stars. Were it not
        so, infinite time past would have exhausted all the matter in the
        universe, but Nature is clearly immortal. Moreover, there is a
        correspondence between the structure of bodies and the forces necessary
        to their destruction. Finally, apparent violations of the law, when
        carefully examined, only tend to confirm it. The rains no doubt
        disappear, but it is that their particles may reappear in the juices of
        the crops and the trees and the beasts which feed on them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nor need we be surprised at the doctrine that the atoms, so all-powerful
        in the formation of things, are themselves invisible. The same is true
        of the forest-rending blasts, the 'viewless winds' which lash the waves
        and overwhelm great fleets. There are odours also that float unseen upon
        the air; there are heat, and cold, and voices. There is the process of
        evaporation, whereby we know that the water has gone, yet cannot see its
        vapour departing. There is the gradual invisible detrition of rings upon
        the finger, of stones hollowed out by dripping water, of the ploughshare
        in the field, and the flags upon the streets, and the brazen statues of
        the gods whose fingers men kiss as they pass the gates, and the rocks
        that the salt sea-brine eats into along the shore.
      </p>

      <p>
        That there is Empty Space or Void he proves by all the varied motions on
        land and sea which we behold; by the porosity even of hardest things, as
        we see in dripping caves. There is the food also which disperses itself
        throughout the body, in trees and cattle. Voices pass through closed
        doors, frost can pierce even to the bones. Things equal in size vary in
        weight; a lump of wool has more of void in it than a lump of lead. So
        much for Lucretius.
      </p>

      <p>
        For abstract theories on physics, except as an adjunct and support to
        his moral conceptions, Epicurus seems to have had very little
        inclination. He thus speaks of the visible universe or Cosmos. The
        Cosmos is a sort of skyey enclosure, which holds within it the stars,
        the earth, and all visible things. It is cut off from the infinite by a
        wall of division which may be either rare or dense, in motion or at
        rest, round or three-cornered or any other form. That there is such a
        wall of division is quite admissible, for no object of which we have
        observation is without its limit. Were this wall of division to break,
        everything contained within it would tumble out. We may conceive that
        there are an infinite number of such Cosmic systems, with inter-cosmic
        intervals throughout the infinity of space.
      </p>

      <p>
        He is very disinclined to assume that similar phenomena, e.g. eclipses
        of the sun or moon, always have the same cause. The various accidental
        implications and interminglings of the atoms may produce the same effect
        in various ways. In fact Epicurus has the same impatience of theoretical
        physics as of theoretical philosophy. He is a 'practical man.'
      </p>

      <p>
        He is getting nearer his object when he comes to the nature of the soul.
        The soul, like everything else, is composed of atoms, extremely delicate
        and fine. It very much resembles the breath, with a mixture of heat
        thrown in, sometimes coming nearer in nature to the first, sometimes to
        the second. Owing to the delicacy of its composition it is extremely
        subject to variation, as we see in its passions and liability to
        emotion, its phases of thought and the varied experiences without which
        we cannot live. It is, moreover, the chief cause of sensation being
        possible for us. Not that it could of itself have had sensation, without
        the enwrapping support of the rest of the structure. The rest of the
        structure, in fact, having prepared this chief cause, gets from it a
        share of what comes to it, but not a share of all which the soul has.
      </p>

      <p>
        The soul being of material composition equally with the other portions
        of the bodily structure, dies of course with it, that is, its particles
        like the rest are dispersed, to form new bodies. There is nothing
        dreadful therefore about death, for there is nothing left to know or
        feel anything about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        As regards the process of sensation, Epicurus, like Democritus,
        conceived bodies as having a power of emitting from their surface
        extremely delicate images of themselves. These are composed of very fine
        atoms, but, in spite of their tenuity, they are able to maintain for a
        considerable time their relative form and order, though liable after a
        time to distortion. They fly with great celerity through the void, and
        find their way through the windows of the senses to the soul, which by
        its delicacy of nature is in sympathy with them, and apprehends their
        form.
      </p>

      <p>
        The gods are indestructible, being composed of the very finest and
        subtlest atoms, so as to have not a body, but as it were a body. Their
        life is one of perfect blessedness and peace. They are in number
        countless; but the conceptions of the vulgar are erroneous respecting
        them. They are not subject to the passions of humanity. Anger and joy
        are alike alien to their nature; for all such feelings imply a lack of
        strength. They dwell apart in the inter-cosmic spaces. As Cicero
        jestingly remarks: "Epicurus by way of a joke introduced his gods so
        pure that you could see through them, so delicate that the wind could
        blow through them, having their dwelling-place outside between two
        worlds, for fear of breakage."
      </p>

      <p>
        Coming finally to Epicurus' theory of Ethics, we find a general
        resemblance to the doctrine of Democritus and Aristippus. The end of
        life is pleasure or the absence of pain. He differs, however, from the
        Cyrenaics in maintaining that not the pleasure of the moment is the end,
        but pleasure throughout the whole of life, and that therefore we ought
        in our conduct to have regard to the future. Further he denies that
        pleasure exists only in activity, it exists equally in rest and quiet;
        in short, he places more emphasis in his definition on the absence of
        pain or disturbance, than on the presence of positive pleasure. And
        thirdly, while the Cyrenaics maintained that bodily pleasures and pains
        were the keenest, Epicurus claimed these characteristics for the
        pleasures of the mind, which intensified the present feeling by
        anticipations of the future and recollections of the past. And thus the
        wise man might be happy, even on the rack. Better indeed was it to be
        unlucky and wise, than lucky and foolish. In a similar temper Epicurus
        on his death-bed wrote thus to a friend: "In the enjoyment of
        blessedness and peace, on this the last day of my life I write this
        letter to you. Strangury has supervened, and the extremest agony of
        internal pains, yet resisting these has been my joy of soul, as I
        recalled the thoughts which I have had in the past."
      </p>

      <p>
        We must note, however, that while mental pleasures counted for much with
        the Epicureans, these mental pleasures consisted not in thought for
        thought's sake in any form; they had nothing to do with contemplation.
        They were essentially connected with bodily experiences; they were the
        memory of past, the anticipation of future, bodily pleasures. For it is
        to be remembered that thoughts were with Epicurus only converted
        sensations, and sensations were bodily processes. Thus every joy of the
        mind was conditioned by a bodily experience preceding it. Or as
        Metrodorus, Epicurus' disciple, defined the matter: "A man is happy when
        his body is in good case, and he has good hope that it will continue
        so." Directly or indirectly, therefore, every happiness came back, in
        the rough phrase of Epicurus, to one's belly at last.
      </p>

      <p>
        This theory did not, however, reduce morality to bestial
        self-indulgence. If profligate pleasures could be had free from mental
        apprehensions of another world and of death and pain and disease in
        this, and if they brought with them guidance as to their own proper
        restriction, there would be no reason whatever to blame a man for
        filling himself to the full of pleasures, which brought no pain or
        sorrow, that is, no evil, in their train. But (Epicurus argues) this is
        far from being the case. Moreover there are many pleasures keen enough
        at the time, which are by no means pleasant in the remembering. And even
        when we have them they bring no enjoyment to the highest parts of our
        nature. What those 'highest parts' are, and by what standard their
        relative importance is determined, Epicurus does not say. He probably
        meant those parts of our nature which had the widest range in space and
        time, our faculties, namely, of memory and hope, of conception, of sight
        and hearing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover there are distinctions among desires; some are both natural and
        compulsory, such as thirst; some are natural but not compulsory, as the
        desire for dainties; some are neither natural nor compulsory, such as
        the desire for crowns or statues. The last of these the wise man will
        contemn, the second he will admit, but so as to retain his freedom. For
        independence of such things is desirable, not necessarily that we may
        reduce our wants to a minimum, but in order that if we cannot enjoy many
        things, we may be content with few. "For I am convinced," Epicurus
        continues, "that they have the greatest enjoyment of wealth, who are
        least dependent upon it for enjoyment."
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus if Epicurus did not absolutely teach simplicity of living, he
        taught his disciples the necessity of being capable of such simplicity,
        which they could hardly be without practice. So that in reality the
        doctrine of Epicurus came very near that of his opponents. As Seneca the
        Stoic observed, "Pleasure with him comes to be something very thin and
        pale. In fact that law which we declare for virtue, the same law he lays
        down for pleasure."
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the chief and highest pleasures of life Epicurus found in the
        possession of friends, who provided for each other not only help and
        protection, but a lifelong joy. For the 'larger friendship' of the civic
        community, Epicurus seems to have had only a very neutral regard.
        Justice, he says, is a convention of interests, with a view of neither
        hurting or being hurt. The wise man will have nothing to do with
        politics, if he can help it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of much that may offend in the doctrines of Epicurus, there is
        much at least in the man which is sympathetic and attractive. What one
        observes, however, when we compare such a philosophy with that of Plato
        or Aristotle, is first, a total loss of constructive imagination. The
        parts of the 'philosophy,' if we are so to call it, of Epicurus hang
        badly together, and neither the Canonics nor the Physics show any real
        faculty of serious thinking at all. The Ethics has a wider scope and a
        more real relation to experience if not to reason. But it can never
        satisfy the deeper apprehension of mankind.

        The truest and most permanently valid revelations of life come not to
        the many but to the one or the few, who communicate the truth to the
        many, sometimes at the cost of their own lives, always at the cost of
        antagonism and ridicule. A philosophy therefore which only represents in
        theoretical form the average practice of the average man, comes into the
        world still-born. It has nothing to say; its hearers know it all, and
        the exact value of it all, already. And in their heart of hearts, many
        even of those who have stooped to a lower ideal, and sold their
        birthright of hopes beyond the passing hour, for a mess of pottage in
        the form of material success and easy enjoyment, have a lurking contempt
        for the preachers of what they practise; as many a slaveholder in
        America probably had for the clerical defenders of the 'divine
        institution.'

        There is a wasting sense of inadequacy in this 'hand-to-mouth' theory of
        living, which compels most of those who follow it to tread softly and
        speak moderately. They are generally a little weary if not cynical; they
        don't think much of themselves or of their success; but they prefer to
        hold on as they have begun, rather than launch out into new courses,
        which they feel they have not the moral force to continue. "May I die,"
        said the Cynic, "rather than lead a life of pleasure." "May I die," says
        the Epicurean, "rather than make a fool of myself." The Idealist is to
        them, if not a hypocrite, at least a visionary,—if not a Tartuffe, at
        least a Don Quixote tilting at windmills. Yet even for poor Don Quixote,
        with all his blindness and his follies, the world retains a sneaking
        admiration. It can spare a few or a good many of its worldly-wisdoms,
        rather than lose altogether its enthusiasms and its dreams. And the one
        thing which saves Epicureanism from utter extinction as a theory, is
        invariably the idealism which like a 'purple patch' adorns it here and
        there. No man and no theory is wholly self-centred. Pleasure is
        supplanted by Utility, and Utility becomes the greatest Happiness of the
        greatest Number, and so, as Horace says (Ep. I. x. 24)—

        Nature (like Love) thrust out of the door, will come back by the window;
        and the Idealism which is not allowed to make pain a pleasure, is
        required at last to translate pleasure into pains.
