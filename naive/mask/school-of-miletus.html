      <h1>School of Miletus</h1>

      <p>
        For several centuries prior to the great Persian invasions of Greece,
        perhaps the very greatest and wealthiest city of the Greek world was
        Miletus. Situate about the centre of the Ionian coasts of Asia Minor,
        with four magnificent harbours and a strongly defensible position, it
        gathered to itself much of the great overland trade, which has flowed
        for thousands of years eastward and westward between India and the
        Mediterranean; while by its great fleets it created a new world of its
        own along the Black Sea coast. Its colonies there were so numerous that
        Miletus was named 'Mother of Eighty Cities.' From Abydus on the
        Bosphorus, past Sinope, and so onward to the Crimea and the Don, and
        thence round to Thrace, a busy community of colonies, mining,
        manufacturing, ship-building, corn-raising, owned Miletus for their
        mother-city. Its marts must therefore have been crowded with merchants
        of every country from India to Spain, from Arabia to Russia; the riches
        and the wonders of every clime must have become familiar to its
        inhabitants. And fitly enough, therefore, in this city was born the
        first notable Greek geographer, the first constructor of a map, the
        first observer of natural and other curiosities, the first recorder of
        varieties of custom among various communities, the first speculator on
        the causes of strange phenomena,—Hecataeus. His work is in great part
        lost, but we know a good deal about it from the frequent references to
        him and it in the work of his rival and follower, Herodotus.
      </p>

      <p>
        The city naturally held a leading place politically as well as
        commercially. Empire in our sense was alien to the instincts of the
        Greek race; but Miletus was for centuries recognised as the foremost
        member of a great commercial and political league, the political
        character of the league becoming more defined, as first the Lydian and
        then the Persian monarchy became an aggressive neighbour on its borders.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was in this active, prosperous, enterprising state, and at the period
        of its highest activity, that Thales, statesman, practical engineer,
        mathematician, philosopher, flourished. Without attempting to fix his
        date too closely, we may take it that he was a leading man in Miletus
        for the greater part of the first half of the sixth century before
        Christ. We hear of an eclipse predicted by him, of the course of a river
        usefully changed, of shrewd and profitable handling of the market, of
        wise advice in the general councils of the league. He seems to have been
        at once a student of mathematics and an observer of nature, and withal
        something having analogy with both, an inquirer or speculator into the
        origin of things. To us nowadays this suggests a student of geology, or
        physiography, or some such branch of physical science; to Thales it
        probably rather suggested a theoretical inquiry into the simplest
        thinkable aspect of things as existing. "Under what form known to us,"
        he would seem to have asked, "may we assume an identity in all known
        things, so as best to cover or render explicable the things as we know
        them?" The 'beginning' of things (for it was thus he described this
        assumed identity) was not conceived by him as something which was long
        ages before, and which had ceased to be; rather it meant the reality of
        things now. Thales then was the putter of a question, which had not been
        asked expressly before, but which has never ceased to be asked since. He
        was also the formulator of a new meaning for a word; the word
        'beginning' (Greek arche) got the meaning of 'underlying reality' and so
        of 'ending' as well. In short, he so dealt with a word, on the surface
        of it implying time, as to eliminate the idea of time, and suggest a
        method of looking at the world, more profound and far-reaching than had
        been before imagined.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is interesting to find that the man who was thus the first
        philosopher, the first observer who took a metaphysical, non-temporal,
        analytical view of the world, and so became the predecessor of all those
        votaries of 'other-world' ways of thinking,—whether as academic
        idealist, or 'budge doctor of the Stoic fur,' or Christian ascetic or
        what not, whose ways are such a puzzle to the 'hard-headed practical
        man,'—was himself one of the shrewdest men of his day, so shrewd that by
        common consent he was placed foremost in antiquity among the Seven
        Sages, or seven shrewd men, whose practical wisdom became a world's
        tradition, enshrined in anecdote and crystallised in proverb.
      </p>

      <p>
        The chief record that we possess of the philosophic teaching of Thales
        is contained in an interesting notice of earlier philosophies by
        Aristotle, the main part of which as regards Thales runs as follows:
      </p>

      <p>
        "The early philosophers as a rule formulated the originative principle
        (Greek arche) of all things under some material expression. By the
        originative principle or element of things they meant that of which all
        existing things are composed, that which determines their coming into
        being, and into which they pass on ceasing to be. Where these
        philosophers differed from each other was simply in the answer which
        they gave to the question what was the nature of this principle, the
        differences of view among them applying both to the number, and to the
        character, of the supposed element or elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Thales, the pioneer of this philosophy, maintained that Water was the
        originative principle of all things. It was doubtless in this sense that
        he said that the earth rested on water. What suggested the conception to
        him may have been such facts of observation, as that all forms of
        substance which promote life are moist, that heat itself seems to be
        conditioned by moisture, that the life-producing seed in all creatures
        is moist, and so on."
      </p>

      <p>
        Other characteristics of water, it is elsewhere suggested, may have been
        in Thales' mind, such as its readiness to take various shapes, its
        convertibility from water into vapour or ice, its ready mixture with
        other substances, and so forth. What we have chiefly to note is, that
        the more unscientific this theory about the universe may strike us as
        being, the more completely out of accord with facts now familiar to
        everybody, the more striking is it as marking a new mood of mind, in
        which unity, though only very partially suggested or discoverable by the
        senses, is preferred to that infinite and indefinite variety and
        difference which the senses give us at every moment. There is here the
        germ of a new aspiration, of a determination not to rest in the merely
        momentary and different, but at least to try, even against the apparent
        evidence of the senses, for something more permanently intelligible. As
        a first suggestion of what this permanent underlying reality may be,
        Water might very well pass. It is probable that even to Thales himself
        it was only a symbol, like the figure in a mathematical proposition,
        representing by the first passable physical phenomenon which came to
        hand, that ideal reality underlying all change, which is at once the
        beginning, the middle, and the end of all. That he did not mean Water,
        in the ordinary prosaic sense, to be identical with this, is suggested
        by some other sayings of his. "Thales," says Aristotle elsewhere,
        "thought the whole universe was full of gods." "All things," he is
        recorded as saying, "have a soul in them, in virtue of which they move
        other things, and are themselves moved, even as the magnet, by virtue of
        its life or soul, moves the iron." Without pushing these fragmentary
        utterances too far, we may well conclude that whether Thales spoke of
        the soul of the universe and its divine indwelling powers, or gods, or
        of water as the origin of things, he was only vaguely symbolising in
        different ways an idea as yet formless and void, like the primeval
        chaos, but nevertheless, like it, containing within it a promise and a
        potency of greater life hereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our information with respect to thinkers so remote as these men is too
        scanty and too fragmentary, to enable us to say in what manner or degree
        they influenced each other. We cannot say for certain that any one of
        them was pupil or antagonist of another. They appear each of them, one
        might say for a moment only, from amidst the darkness of antiquity; a
        few sayings of theirs we catch vaguely across the void, and then they
        disappear. There is not, consequently, any very distinct progression or
        continuity observable among them, and so far therefore one has to
        confess that the title 'School of Miletus' is a misnomer. We have
        already quoted the words of Aristotle in which he classes the Ionic
        philosophers together, as all of them giving a material aspect of some
        kind to the originative principle of the universe. But while this is a
        characteristic observable in some of them, it is not so obviously
        discoverable in the second of their number, Anaximander.
      </p>

      <p>
        This philosopher is said to have been younger by one generation than
        Thales, but to have been intimate with him. He, like Thales, was a
        native of Miletus, and while we do not hear of him as a person, like
        Thales, of political eminence and activity, he was certainly the equal,
        if not the superior, of Thales in mathematical and scientific ability.
        He is said to have either invented or at least made known to Greece the
        construction of the sun-dial. He was associated with Hecataeus in the
        construction of the earliest geographical charts or maps; he devoted
        himself with some success to the science of astronomy. His familiarity
        with the abstractions of mathematics perhaps accounts for the more
        abstract form, in which he expressed his idea of the principle of all
        things.
      </p>

      <p>
        To Anaximander this principle was, as he expressed it, the infinite; not
        water nor any other of the so-called elements, but a different thing
        from any of them, something hardly namable, out of whose formlessness
        the heavens and all the worlds in them came to be. And by necessity into
        that same infinite or indefinite existence, out of which they originally
        emerged, did every created thing return. Thus, as he poetically
        expressed it, "Time brought its revenges, and for the wrong-doing of
        existence all things paid the penalty of death."
      </p>

      <p>
        The momentary resting-place of Thales on the confines of the familiar
        world of things, in his formulation of Water as the principle of
        existence, is thus immediately removed. We get, as it were, to the
        earliest conception of things as we find it in Genesis; before the
        heavens were, or earth, or the waters under the earth, or light, or sun,
        or moon, or grass, or the beast of the field, when the "earth was
        without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep."
        Only, be it observed, that while in the primitive Biblical idea this
        formless void precedes in time an ordered universe, in Anaximander's
        conception this formless infinitude is always here, is in fact the only
        reality which ever is here, something without beginning or ending,
        underlying all, enwrapping all, governing all.
      </p>

      <p>
        To modern criticism this may seem to be little better than verbiage,
        having, perhaps, some possibilities of poetic treatment, but certainly
        very unsatisfactory if regarded as science. But to this we have to reply
        that one is not called upon to regard it as science. Behind science, as
        much to-day when our knowledge of the details of phenomena is so
        enormously increased, as in the times when science had hardly begun,
        there lies a world of mystery which we cannot pierce, and yet which we
        are compelled to assume. No scientific treatise can begin without
        assuming Matter and Force as data, and however much we may have learned
        about the relations of forces and the affinities of things, Matter and
        Force as such remain very much the same dim infinities, that the
        originative 'Infinite' was to Anaximander.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is to be noted, however, that while modern science assumes
        necessarily two correlative data or originative principles,—Force,
        namely, as well as Matter,—Anaximander seems to have been content with
        the formulation of but one; and perhaps it is just here that a kinship
        still remains between him and Thales and other philosophers of the
        school. He, no more than they, seems to have definitely raised the
        question, How are we to account for, or formulate, the principle of
        difference or change? What is it that causes things to come into being
        out of, or recalls them back from being into, the infinite void? It is
        to be confessed, however, that our accounts on this point are somewhat
        conflicting. One authority actually says that he formulated motion as
        eternal also. So far as he attempted to grasp the idea of difference in
        relation to that of unity, he seems to have regarded the principle of
        change or difference as inhering in the infinite itself. Aristotle in
        this connection contrasts his doctrine with that of Anaxagoras, who
        formulated two principles of existence—Matter and Mind. Anaximander, he
        points out, found all he wanted in the one.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a mathematician Anaximander must have been familiar in various
        aspects with the functions of the Infinite or Indefinable in the
        organisation of thought. To the student of Euclid, for example, the
        impossibility of adequately defining any of the fundamental elements of
        the science of geometry—the point, the line, the surface—is a familiar
        fact. In so far as a science of geometry is possible at all, the
        exactness, which is its essential characteristic, is only attainable by
        starting from data which are in themselves impossible, as of a point
        which has no magnitude, of a line which has no breadth, of a surface
        which has no thickness. So in the science of abstract number the
        fundamental assumptions, as that 1=1, x=x, etc., are contradicted by
        every fact of experience, for in the world as we know it, absolute
        equality is simply impossible to discover; and yet these fundamental
        conceptions are in their development most powerful instruments for the
        extension of man's command over his own experiences. Their completeness
        of abstraction from the accidents of experience, from the differences,
        qualifications, variations which contribute so largely to the personal
        interests of life, this it is which makes the abstract sciences
        demonstrative, exact, and universally applicable. In so far, therefore,
        as we are permitted to grasp the conception of a perfectly abstract
        existence prior to, and underlying, and enclosing, all separate
        existences, so far also do we get to a conception which is
        demonstrative, exact, and universally applicable throughout the whole
        world of knowable objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Such a conception, however, by its absolute emptiness of content, does
        not afford any means in itself of progression; somehow and somewhere a
        principle of movement, of development, of concrete reality, must be
        found or assumed, to link this ultimate abstraction of existence to the
        multifarious phenomena of existence as known. And it was, perhaps,
        because Anaximander failed to work out this aspect of the question, that
        in the subsequent leaders of the school movement, rather than mere
        existence, was the principle chiefly insisted upon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before passing, however, to these successors of Anaximander, some
        opinions of his which we have not perhaps the means of satisfactorily
        correlating with his general conception, but which are not without their
        individual interest, may here be noted. The word husk or bark (Greek
        phloios) seems to have been a favourite one with him, as implying and
        depicting a conception of interior and necessary development in things.
        Thus he seems to have postulated an inherent tendency or law in the
        infinite, which compelled it to develop contrary characters, as hot and
        cold, dry and moist. In consequence of this fundamental tendency an
        envelope of fire, he says, came into being, encircling another envelope
        of air, which latter in turn enveloped the sphere of earth, each being
        like the 'husk' of the other, or like the bark which encloses the tree.
        This concentric system he conceives as having in some way been parted up
        into various systems, represented by the sun, the moon, the stars, and
        the earth. The last he figured as hanging in space, and deriving its
        stability from the inherent and perfect balance or relation of its
        parts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, again, as to the origin of man, he seems to have in like manner
        taught a theory of development from lower forms of life. In his view the
        first living creatures must have come into being in moisture (thus
        recalling the theory of Thales). As time went on, and these forms of
        life reached their fuller possibilities, they came to be transferred to
        the dry land, casting off their old nature like a husk or bark. More
        particularly he insists that man must have developed out of other and
        lower forms of life, because of his exceptional need, under present
        conditions, of care and nursing in his earlier years. Had he come into
        being at once as a human creature he could never have survived.
      </p>

      <p>
        The analogies of these theories with modern speculations are obvious and
        interesting. But without enlarging on these, one has only to say in
        conclusion that, suggestive and interesting as many of these poor
        fragments, these disjecti membra poetae, are individually, they leave us
        more and more impressed with a sense of incompleteness in our knowledge
        of Anaximander's theory as a whole. It may be that as a consistent and
        perfected system the theory never was worked out; it may be that it
        never was properly understood.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anaximenes was also a native of Miletus, and is said to have been a
        hearer or pupil of Anaximander. As we have said, the tendency of the
        later members of the school was towards emphasising the motive side of
        the supposed underlying principle of nature, and accordingly Anaximenes
        chose Air as the element which best represented or symbolised that
        principle. Its fluidity, readiness of movement, wide extension, and
        absolute neutrality of character as regards colour, taste, smell, form,
        etc., were obvious suggestions. The breath also, whose very name to the
        ancients implied an identity with the life or soul, was nothing but air;
        and the identification of Air with Life supplied just that principle of
        productiveness and movement, which was felt to be necessary in the
        primal element of being. The process of existence, then, he conceived as
        consisting in a certain concentration of this diffused life-giving
        element into more or less solidified forms, and the ultimate separation
        and expansion of these back into the formless air again. The contrary
        forces previously used by Anaximander—heat and cold, drought and
        moisture—are with Anaximenes also the agencies which institute these
        changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is pretty nearly all that we know of Anaximenes. So far as the few
        known facts reveal him, we can hardly say that except as supplying a
        step towards the completer development of the motive idea in being, he
        greatly adds to the chain of progressive thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although not a native of Miletus, but of Ephesus, Heraclitus, both by
        his nationality as an Ionian and by his position in the development of
        philosophic conceptions, falls naturally to be classed with the
        philosophers of Miletus. His period may be given approximately as from
        about 560 to 500 B.C., though others place him a generation later. Few
        authentic particulars have been preserved of him. We hear of extensive
        travels, of his return to his native city only to refuse a share in its
        activities, of his retirement to a hermit's life. He seems to have
        formed a contrast to the preceding philosophers in his greater
        detachment from the ordinary interests of civic existence; and much in
        his teaching suggests the ascetic if not the misanthrope. He received
        the nickname of 'The Obscure,' from the studied mystery in which he was
        supposed to involve his teaching. He wrote not for the vulgar, but for
        the gifted few. 'Much learning makes not wise' was the motto of his
        work; the man of gift, of insight, that man is better than ten thousand.
        He was savage in his criticism of other writers, even the greatest.
        Homer, he said, and Archilochus too, deserved to be hooted from the
        platform and thrashed. Even the main purport of his writings was
        differently interpreted. Some named his work 'The Muses,' as though it
        were chiefly a poetic vision; others named it 'The sure Steersman to the
        Goal of Life'; others, more prosaically, 'A Treatise of Nature.'
      </p>

      <p>
        The fundamental principle or fact of being Heraclitus formulated in the
        famous dictum, 'All things pass.' In the eternal flux or flow of being
        consisted its reality; even as in a river the water is ever changing,
        and the river exists as a river only in virtue of this continual change;
        or as in a living body, wherein while there is life there is no
        stability or fixedness; stability and fixedness are the attributes of
        the unreal image of life, not of life itself. Thus, as will be observed,
        from the material basis of being as conceived by Thales, with only a
        very vague conception of the counter-principle of movement, philosophy
        has wheeled round in Heraclitus to the other extreme; he finds his
        permanent element in the negation of permanence; being or reality
        consists in never 'being' but always 'becoming,' not in stability but in
        change.
      </p>

      <p>
        This eternal movement he pictures elsewhere as an eternal strife of
        opposites, whose differences nevertheless consummate themselves in
        finest harmony. Thus oneness emerges out of multiplicity, multiplicity
        out of oneness; and the harmony of the universe is of contraries, as of
        the lyre and the bow. War is the father and king and lord of all things.
        Neither god nor man presided at the creation of anything that is; that
        which was, is that which is, and that which ever shall be; even an
        ever-living Fire, ever kindling and ever being extinguished.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus in Fire, as an image or symbol of the underlying reality of
        existence, Heraclitus advanced to the furthest limit attainable on
        physical lines, for the expression of its essentially motive character.
        That this Fire was no more than a symbol, suggested by the special
        characteristics of fire in nature,—its subtlety, its mobility, its power
        of penetrating all things and devouring all things, its powers for
        beneficence in the warmth of living bodies and the life-giving power of
        the sun,—is seen in the fact that he readily varies his expression for
        this principle, calling it at times the Thunderbolt, at others the
        eternal Reason, or Law, or Fate. To his mental view creation was a
        process eternally in action, the fiery element descending by the law of
        its being into the cruder forms of water and earth, only to be resolved
        again by upward process into fire; even as one sees the vapour from the
        sea ascending and melting into the aether. As a kindred vapour or
        exhalation he recognised the Soul or Breath for a manifestation of the
        essential element. It is formless, ever changing with every breath we
        take, yet it is the constructive and unifying force which keeps the body
        together, and conditions its life and growth. At this point Heraclitus
        comes into touch with Anaximenes. In the act of breathing we draw into
        our own being a portion of the all-pervading vital element of all being;
        in this universal being we thereby live and move and have our
        consciousness; the eternal and omnipresent wisdom becomes, through the
        channels of our senses, and especially through the eyes, in fragments at
        least our wisdom. In sleep we are not indeed cut off wholly from this
        wisdom; through our breathing we hold as it were to its root; but of its
        flower we are then deprived. On awaking again we begin once more to
        partake according to our full measure of the living thought; even as
        coals when brought near the fire are themselves made partakers of it,
        but when taken away again become quenched.

        Hence, in so far as man is wise, it is because his spirit is kindled by
        union with the universal spirit; but there is a baser, or, as Heraclitus
        termed it, a moister element also in him, which is the element of
        unreason, as in a drunken man. And thus the trustworthiness or otherwise
        of the senses, as the channels of communication with the divine, depends
        on the dryness or moistness,—or, as we should express it, using, after
        all, only another metaphor,—on the elevation or baseness of the spirit
        that is within. To those whose souls are base and barbarous, the eternal
        movement, the living fire, is invisible; and thus what they do see is
        nothing but death. Immersed in the mere appearances of things and their
        supposed stability, they, whether sleeping or waking, behold only dead
        forms; their spirits are dead.

        For the guidance of life there is no law but the common sense, which is
        the union of those fragmentary perceptions of eternal law, which
        individual men attain, in so far as their spirits are dry and pure. Of
        absolute knowledge human nature is not capable, but only the Divine. To
        the Eternal, therefore, alone all things are good and beautiful and
        just, because to Him alone do things appear in their totality. To the
        human partial reason some things are unjust and others just. Hence life,
        by reason of the limitations involved in it, he sometimes spoke of as
        the death of the soul, and death as the renewal of its life. And so, in
        the great events of man's life and in the small, as in the mighty circle
        of the heavens, good and evil, life and death, growth and decay, are but
        the systole and diastole, the outward and inward pulsation, of an
        eternal good, an eternal harmony. Day and night, winter and summer, war
        and peace, satiety and hunger—each conditions the other, all are part of
        God. It is sickness that makes health good and sweet, hunger that gives
        its pleasure to feeding, weariness that makes sleep a good.

        This vision of existence in its eternal flux and interchange, seems to
        have inspired Heraclitus with a contemplative melancholy. In the
        traditions of later times he was known as the weeping philosopher.
        Lucian represents him as saying, "To me it is a sorrow that there is
        nothing fixed or secure, and that all things are thrown confusedly
        together, so that pleasure and pain, knowledge and ignorance, the great
        and the small, are the same, ever circling round and passing one into
        the other in the sport of time." "Time," he says elsewhere, "is like a
        child that plays with the dice." The highest good, therefore, for
        mortals is that clarity of perception in respect of oneself and all that
        is, whereby we shall learn to apprehend somewhat of the eternal unity
        and harmony, that underlies the good and evil of time, the shock and
        stress of circumstance and place. The highest virtue for man is a placid
        and a quiet constancy, whatever the changes and chances of life may
        bring. It is the pantheistic apathy.

        The sadder note of humanity, the note of Euripides and at times of
        Sophocles, the note of Dante and of the Tempest of Shakespeare, of
        Shelley and Arnold and Carlyle,—this note we hear thus early and thus
        clear, in the dim and distant utterances of Heraclitus. The mystery of
        existence, the unreality of what seems most real, the intangibility and
        evanescence of all things earthly,—these thoughts obscurely echoing to
        us across the ages from Heraclitus, have remained, and always will
        remain, among the deepest and most insistent of the world's thoughts, in
        its sincerest moments and in its greatest thinkers.
