      <h1>Logic</h1>

      <p>
        The Stoics had a tremendous reputation for logic. In this department
        they were the successors or rather the supersessors of Aristotle. For
        after the death of Theophrastus the library of the Lyceum is said to
        have been buried underground at Scepsis until about a century before
        Christ, So that the Organon may actually have been lost to the world
        during that period. At all events under Strato the successor of
        Theophrastus who specialized in natural science the school had lost its
        comprehensiveness. Cicero even finds it consonant with dramatic
        propriety to make Cato charge the later Peripatetics with ignorance of
        logic! On the other hand Chrysippus became so famous for his logic as to
        create a general impression that if there were a logic among the gods it
        would be no other than the Chrysippean.
      </p>

      <p>
        But if the Stoics were strong in logic they were weak in rhetoric. This
        strength and weakness were characteristic of the school at all periods.
        Cato is the only Roman Stoic to whom Cicero accords the praise of real
        eloquence. In the dying accents of the school as we hear them in Marcus
        Aurelius the imperial sage counts it a thing to be thankful for that he
        had learnt to abstain from rhetoric, poetic, and elegance of diction.
        The reader however cannot help wishing that he had taken some means to
        diminish the crabbedness of his style. If a lesson were wanted in the
        importance of sacrificing to the Graces it might be found in the fact
        that the early Stoic writers despite their logical subtlety have all
        perished and that their remains have to be sought for so largely in the
        pages of Cicero. In speaking of logic as one of the three departments of
        philosophy we must bear in mind that the term was one of much wider
        meaning than it is with us. It included rhetoric, poetic, and grammar as
        well as dialectic or logic proper, to say nothing of disquisitions on
        the senses and the intellect which we should now refer to psychology.
      </p>

      <p>
        Logic as a whole being divided into rhetoric and dialectic: rhetoric was
        defined to be the knowledge of how to speak well in expository
        discourses and dialectic as the knowledge of how to argue rightly in
        matters of question and answer. Both rhetoric and dialectic were spoken
        of by the Stoics as virtues for they divided virtue in its most generic
        sense in the same way as they divided philosophy into physical, ethical,
        and logical. Rhetoric and dialectic were thus the two species of logical
        virtue. Zeno expressed their difference by comparing rhetoric to the
        palm and dialectic to the fist.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of throwing in poetic and grammar with rhetoric, the Stoics
        subdivided dialectic into the part which dealt with the meaning and the
        part which dealt with the sound, or as Chrysippus phrased it, concerning
        significants and significates. Under the former came the treatment of
        the alphabet, of the parts of speech, of solecism, of barbarism, of
        poems, of amphibolies, of metre and music—a list which seems at first
        sight a little mixed, but in which we can recognise the general features
        of grammar, with its departments of phonology, accidence, and prosody.
        The treatment of solecism and barbarism in grammar corresponded to that
        of fallacies in logic. With regard to the alphabet it is worth noting
        that the Stoics recognised seven vowels and six mutes. This is more
        correct than our way of talking of nine mutes, since the aspirate
        consonants are plainly not mute. There were, according to the Stoics,
        five parts of speech—name, appellative, verb, conjunction, article.
        'Name' meant a proper name, and 'appellative' a common term.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were reckoned to be five virtues of speech—Hellenism, clearness,
        conciseness, propriety, distinction. By 'Hellenism' was meant speaking
        good Greek. 'Distinction' was defined to be 'a diction which avoided
        homeliness.' Over against these there were two comprehensive vices,
        barbarism and solecism, the one being an offence against accidence, the
        other against syntax.
      </p>

      <p>
        The famous comparison of the infant mind to a blank sheet of paper,
        which we connect so closely with the name of Locke, really comes from
        the Stoics. The earliest characters inscribed upon it were the
        impressions of sense, which the Greeks called "phantasies." A phantasy
        was defined by Zeno as "an impression in the soul." Cleanthes was
        content to take this definition in its literal sense, and believe that
        the soul was impressed by external objects as wax by a signet ring.
        Chrysippus, however, found a difficulty here, and preferred to interpret
        the Master's saying to mean an alteration or change in the soul. He
        figured to himself the soul as receiving a modification from every
        external object which acts upon it just as the air receives countless
        strokes when many people are speaking at once. Further, he declared that
        in receiving an impression the soul was purely passive and that the
        phantasy revealed not only its own existence, but that also of its
        cause, just as light displays itself and the things that are in it.
        Thus, when through sight we receive an impression of white, an affection
        takes place in the soul, in virtue whereof we are able to say that there
        exists a white object affecting us. The power to name the object resides
        in the understanding. First must come the phantasy, and the
        understanding, having the power of utterance, expresses in speech the
        affection it receives from the object. The cause of the phantasy was
        called the "phantast," <em>e. g.</em> the white or cold object. If there
        is no external cause, then the supposed object of the impression was a
        "phantasm," such as a figure in a dream, or the Furies whom Orestes sees
        in his frenzy.
      </p>

      <p>
        How then was the impression which had reality behind it to be
        distinguished from that which had not? "By the feel" is all that the
        Stoics really had to say in answer to this question. Just as Hume made
        the difference between sense-impressions and ideas to lie in the greater
        vividness of the former, so did they; only Hume saw no necessity to go
        beyond the impression, whereas the Stoics did. Certain impressions, they
        maintained, carried with them an irresistible conviction of their own
        reality, and this, not merely in the sense that they existed; but also
        that they were referable to an external cause. These were called
        "gripping phantasies." Such a phantasy did not need proof of its own
        existence, or of that of its object. It possessed self-evidence. Its
        occurrence was attended with yielding and assent on the part of the
        soul. For it is as natural for the soul to assent to the self-evident as
        it is for it to pursue its proper good. The assent to a griping phantasy
        was called "comprehension," as indicating the firm hold that the soul
        thus took of reality. A gripping phantasy was defined as one which was
        stamped and impressed from an existing object, in virtue of that object
        itself, in such a way as it could not be from a non-existent object. The
        clause "in virtue of that object itself" was put into the definition to
        provide against such a case as that of the mad Orestes, who takes his
        sister to be a Fury. There the impression was derived from an existing
        object, but not from that object as such, but as coloured by the
        imagination of the percipient.
      </p>

      <p>
        The criterion of truth then was no other than the gripping phantasy.
        Such at least was the doctrine of the earlier Stoics, but the later
        added a saving clause, "when there is no impediment." For they were
        pressed by their opponents with such imaginary cases as that of Admetus,
        seeing his wife before him in very deed, and yet not believing it to be
        her. But here there was an impediment. Admetus did not believe that the
        dead could rise. Again Menelaus did not believe in the real Helen when
        he found her on the island of Pharos. But here again there was an
        impediment. For Menelaus could not have been expected to know that he
        had been for ten years fighting for a phantom. When, however, there was
        no such impediment, then they said the gripping phantasy did indeed
        deserve its name, for it almost took men by the hair of the head and
        dragged them to assent.
      </p>

      <p>
        So far we have used "phantasy" only of real or imaginary impressions of
        sense. But the term was not thus restricted by the Stoics, who divided
        phantasies into sensible and not sensible. The latter came through the
        understanding and were of bodiless things which could only be grasped by
        reason. The ideas of Plato they declared existed only in our minds.
        Horse, man, and animal had no substantial existence but were phantasms
        of the soul. The Stoics were thus what we should call Conceptualists.
      </p>

      <p>
        Comprehension too was used in a wider sense than that in which we have
        so far employed it. There was comprehension by the senses as of white
        and black, of rough and smooth, but there was also comprehension by the
        reason of demonstrative conclusions such as that the gods exist and that
        they exercise providence. Here we are reminded of Locke's declaration:
        "'Tis as certain there's a God as that the opposite angles made by the
        intersection of two straight lines are equal." The Stoics indeed had
        great affinities with that thinker or rather he with them. The Stoic
        account of the manner in which the mind arrives at its ideas might
        almost be taken from the first book of Locke's <em>Essay</em>. As many
        as nine ways are enumerated of which the first corresponds to simple
        ideas—
      </p>

      <p>(1) by presentation, as objects of sense</p>
      <p>(2) by likeness, as the idea of Socrates from his picture</p>
      <p>
        (3) by analogy, that is, by increase or decrease, as ideas of giants and
        pigmies from men, or as the notion of the centre of the earth, which is
        reached by the consideration of smaller spheres.
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) by transposition, as the idea of men with eyes in their breasts.
      </p>
      <p>(5) by composition, as the idea of a Centaur.</p>
      <p>(6) by opposition, as the idea of death from that of life.</p>
      <p>
        (7) by a kind of transition, as the meaning of words and the idea of
        place.
      </p>
      <p>(8)by nature, as the notion of the just and the good</p>
      <p>(9)by privation, as handless</p>

      <p>
        The Stoics resembled Locke again in endeavoring to give such a
        definition of knowledge as should cover at once the reports of the
        senses and the relation between ideas. Knowledge was defined by them as
        a sure comprehension or a habit in the acceptance of phantasies which
        was not liable to be changed by reason. On a first hearing these
        definitions might seem limited to sense knowledge but if we bethink
        ourselves of the wider meanings of comprehension and of phantasy, we see
        that the definitions apply as they were meant to apply to the mind's
        grasp upon the force of a demonstration no less than upon the existence
        of a physical object.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zeno, with that touch of oriental symbolism which characterized him,
        used to illustrate to his disciples the steps to knowledge by means of
        gestures. Displaying his right hand with the fingers outstretched he
        would say, "That is a phantasy," then contracting the fingers a little,
        "That is assent," then having closed the fist, "That is comprehension,"
        then clasping the fist closely with the left hand, he would add, "That
        is knowledge."
      </p>

      <p>
        A notion which corresponds to our word concept was defined as a phantasm
        of the understanding of a rational animal. For a notion was but a
        phantasm as it presented itself to a rational mind. In the same way so
        many shillings and sovereigns are in themselves but shillings and
        sovereigns, but when used as passage money they become fare. Notions
        were arrived at partly by nature, partly by teaching and study. The
        former kind of notions were called preconceptions; the latter went
        merely by the generic name.
      </p>

      <p>
        Out of the general ideas which nature imparts to us, reason was
        perfected about the age of fourteen, at the time when the voice—its
        outward and visible sign—attains its full development, and when the
        human animal is complete in other respects as being able to reproduce
        its kind. Thus reason which united us to the gods was not, according to
        the Stoics, a pre-existent principal, but a gradual development out of
        sense. It might truly be said that with them the senses were the
        intellect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being was confined by the Stoics to body, a bold assertion of which we
        shall meet the consequences later. At present it is sufficient to notice
        what havoc it makes among the categories. Of Aristotle's ten categories
        it leaves only the first, Substance, and that only in its narrowest
        sense of Primary Substance. But a substance or body might be regarded in
        four ways—
      </p>

      <p>
        (1) simply as a body<br />
        (2) as a body of a particular kind<br />
        (3) as a body in a particular state<br />
        (4) as a body in a particular relation.
      </p>

      <p>Hence result the four Stoic categories of—</p>

      <p>substrates suchlike so disposed so related</p>

      <p>
        But the bodiless would not be thus conjured out of existence. For what
        was to be made of such things as the meaning of words, time, place, and
        the infinite void? Even the Stoics did not assign body to these, and yet
        they had to be recognized and spoken of. The difficulty was got over by
        the invention of the higher category of somewhat, which should include
        both body and the bodiless. Time was a somewhat, and so was space,
        though neither of them possessed being.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Stoic treatment of the proposition, grammar was very much mixed
        up with logic. They had a wide name which applied to any part of
        diction, whether a word or words, a sentence, or even a syllogism. This
        we shall render by "dict." A dict, then, was defined as "that which
        subsists in correspondence with a rational phantasy." A dict was one of
        the things which the Stoics admitted to be devoid of body. There were
        three things involved when anything was said—the sound, the sense, and
        the external object. Of these the first and the last were bodies, but
        the intermediate one was not a body. This we may illustrate after
        Seneca, as follows: "You see Cato walking. What your eyes see and your
        mind attends to is a body in motion. Then you say, 'Cato is walking'."
        The mere sound indeed of these words is air in motion and therefore a
        body but the meaning of them is not a body but an enouncement about a
        body, which is quite a different thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        On examining such details as are left us of the Stoic logic, the first
        thing which strikes one is its extreme complexity as compared with the
        Aristotelian. It was a scholastic age, and the Stoics refined and
        distinguished to their hearts' content. As regards immediate inference,
        a subject which has been run into subtleties among ourselves, Chrysippus
        estimated that the changes which could be rung on ten propositions
        exceeded a million, but for this assertion he was taken to task by
        Hipparchus the mathematician, who proved that the affirmative
        proposition yielded exactly 103,049 forms and the negative 310,962. With
        us the affirmative proposition is more prolific in consequences than the
        negative. But then, the Stoics were not content with so simple a thing
        as mere negation, but had negative arnetic and privative, to say nothing
        of supernegative propositions. Another noticeable feature is the total
        absence of the three figures of Aristotle and the only moods spoken of
        are the moods of the complex syllogism, such as the
        <em>modus penens</em> in a conjunctive. Their type of reasoning was—
      </p>

      <p>
        If A, then B<br />
        But A<br />
        B
      </p>

      <p>
        The important part played by conjunctive propositions in their logic led
        the Stoics to formulate the following rule with regard to the material
        quality of such propositions: Truth can only be followed by truth, but
        falsehood may be followed by falsehood or truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus if it be truly stated that it is day, any consequence of that
        statement, <em>e.g.</em> that it is light, must be true also. But a
        false statement may lead either way. For instance, if it be falsely
        stated that it is night then the consequence that it is dark is false
        also. But if we say, "The earth flies," which was regarded as not only
        false but impossible [Footnote: Here we may recall the warning of Arago
        to call nothing impossible outside the range of pure mathematics] this
        involves the true consequence that the earth is. Though the simple
        syllogism is not alluded to in the sketch which Diogenes Laertius gives
        of the Stoic logic, it is of frequent occurrence in the accounts left us
        of their arguments. Take for instance the syllogism wherewith Zeno
        advocated the cause of temperance—
      </p>

      <p>
        One does not commit a secret to a man who is drunk.<br />
        One does commit a secret to a good man.<br />
        A good man will not get drunk.
      </p>

      <p>
        The chain argument which we wrongly call the Sorites was also a favorite
        resource with the Stoics. If a single syllogism did not suffice to argue
        men into virtue surely a condensed series must be effectual. And so they
        demonstrated the sufficiency of wisdom for happiness as follows——
      </p>

      <p>
        The wise man is temperate<br />
        The temperate is constant<br />
        The constant is unperturbed<br />
        The unperturbed is free from sorrow<br />
        Whoso is free from sorrow is happy<br />
        The wise man is happy
      </p>

      <p>
        The delight which the early Stoics took in this pure play of the
        intellect led them to pounce with avidity upon the abundant stock of
        fallacies current among the Greeks of their time. These seem—most of
        them—to have been invented by the Megarians and especially by Eubulides
        of Miletus a disciple of Eucleides but they became associated with the
        Stoics both by friends and foes who either praise their subtlety or
        deride their solemnity in dealing with them. Chrysippus himself was not
        above propounding such sophisms as the following—
      </p>

      <p>
        Whoever divulges the mysteries to the uninitiated commits impiety<br />
        The hierophant divulged the mysteries to the uninitiated<br />
        The hierophant commits impiety
      </p>

      <p>
        Anything that you say passes through your mouth<br />
        You say a wagon<br />
        A wagon passes through your mouth
      </p>

      <p>
        He is said to have written eleven books on the No-one fallacy. But what
        seems to have exercised most of his ingenuity was the famous Liar, the
        invention of which is ascribed to Eubulides. This fallacy in its
        simplest form is as follows. If you say truly that you are telling a
        lie, are you lying or telling the truth? Chrysippus set this down as
        inexplicable. Nevertheless he was far from declining to discuss it. For
        we find in the list of his works a treatise in five books on the
        Inexplicables an Introduction to the Liar and Liars for Introduction,
        six books on the Liar itself, a work directed against those who thought
        that such propositions were both false and true, another against those
        who professed to solve the Liar by a process of division, three books on
        the solution of the Liar, and finally a polemic against those who
        asserted that the Liar had its premises false. It was well for poor
        Philetas of Cos that he ended his days before Chrysippus was born,
        though as it was he grew thin and died of the Liar, and his epitaph
        served as a solemn reminder to poets not to meddle with logic—
      </p>

      <p>
        Philetas of Cos am I<br />
        'Twas the Liar who made me die<br />
        And the bad nights caused thereby.
      </p>

      <p>Perhaps we owe him an apology for the translation.</p>
