      <h1>Philosophy among the Greeks and Romans</h1>

      <p>
        Among the Greeks and Romans of the classical age philosophy occupied the
        place taken by religion among ourselves. Their appeal was to reason not
        to revelation. To what, asks Cicero in his Offices, are we to look for
        training in virtue, if not to philosophy? Now, if truth is believed to
        rest upon authority it is natural that it should be impressed upon the
        mind from the earliest age, since the essential thing is that it should
        be believed, but a truth which makes its appeal to reason must be
        content to wait till reason is developed. We are born into the Eastern,
        Western or Anglican communion or some other denomination, but it was of
        his own free choice that the serious minded young Greek or Roman
        embraced the tenets of one of the great sects which divided the world of
        philosophy. The motive which led him to do so in the first instance may
        have been merely the influence of a friend or a discourse from some
        eloquent speaker, but the choice once made was his own choice, and he
        adhered to it as such. Conversions from one sect to another were of
        quite rare occurrence. A certain Dionysius of Heraclea, who went over
        from the Stoics to the Cyrenaics, was ever afterward known as "the
        deserter." It was as difficult to be independent in philosophy as it is
        with us to be independent in politics. When a young man joined a school,
        he committed himself to all its opinions, not only as to the end of
        life, which was the main point of division, but as to all questions on
        all subjects. The Stoic did not differ merely in his ethics from the
        Epicurean; he differed also in his theology and his physics and his
        metaphysics. Aristotle, as Shakespeare knew, thought young men "unfit to
        hear moral philosophy". And yet it was a question—or rather the
        question—of moral philosophy, the answer to which decided the young
        man's opinions on all other points. The language which Cicero sometimes
        uses about the seriousness of the choice made in early life and how a
        young man gets entrammelled by a school before he is really able to
        judge, reminds us of what we hear said nowadays about the danger of a
        young man's taking orders before his opinions are formed. To this it was
        replied that a young man only exercised the right of private judgment in
        selecting the authority whom he should follow, and, having once done
        that, trusted to him for all the rest. With the analogue of this
        contention also we are familiar in modern times. Cicero allows that
        there would be something in it, if the selection of the true philosopher
        did not above all things require the philosophic mind. But in those days
        it was probably the case, as it is now, that, if a man did not form
        speculative opinions in youth, the pressure of affairs would not leave
        him leisure to do so later.

        The life span of Zeno, the founder of Stoicism, was from B.C. 347 to
        275. He did not begin teaching till 315, at the mature age of forty.
        Aristotle had passed away in 322, and with him closed the great
        constructive era of Greek thought. The Ionian philosophers had
        speculated on the physical constitution of the universe, the
        Pythagoreans on the mystical properties of numbers; Heraclitus had
        propounded his philosophy of fire, Democritus and Leucippus had struck
        out a rude form of the atomic theory, Socrates had raised questions
        relating to man, Plato had discussed them with all the freedom of the
        dialogue, while Aristotle had systematically worked them out. The later
        schools did not add much to the body of philosophy. What they did was to
        emphasize different sides of the doctrine of their predecessors and to
        drive views to their logical consequences. The great lesson of Greek
        philosophy is that it is worth while to do right irrespective of reward
        and punishment and regardless of the shortness of life. This lesson the
        Stoics so enforced by the earnestness of their lives and the influence
        of their moral teaching that it has become associated more particularly
        with them. Cicero, though he always classed himself as an Academic,
        exclaims in one place that he is afraid the Stoics are the only
        philosophers, and whenever he is combating Epicureanism his language is
        that of a Stoic. Some of Vergil's most eloquent passages seem to be
        inspired by Stoic speculation. Even Horace, despite his banter about the
        sage, in his serious moods borrows the language of the Stoics. It was
        they who inspired the highest flights of declamatory eloquence in
        Persius and Juvenal. Their moral philosophy affected the world through
        Roman law, the great masters of which were brought up under its
        influence. So all pervasive indeed was this moral philosophy of the
        Stoics that it was read by the Jews of Alexandria into Moses under the
        veil of allegory and was declared to be the inner meaning of the Hebrew
        Scriptures. If the Stoics then did not add much to the body of
        Philosophy, they did a great work in popularising it and bringing it to
        bear upon life.

        An intense practicality was a mark of the later Greek philosophy. This
        was common to Stoicism with its rival Epicureanism. Both regarded
        philosophy as 'the art of life,' though they differed in their
        conception of what that art should be. Widely as the two schools were
        opposed to one another, they had also other features in common. Both
        were children of an age in which the free city had given way to
        monarchies, and personal had taken the place of corporate life. The
        question of happiness is no longer, as with Aristotle, and still more
        with Plato, one for the state, but for the individual. In both schools
        the speculative interest was feeble from the first, and tended to become
        feebler as time went on. Both were new departures from pre-existent
        schools. Stoicism was bred out of Cynicism, as Epicureanism out of
        Cyrenaicism. Both were content to fall back for their physics upon the
        pre-Socratic schools, the one adopting the firm philosophy of
        Heraclitus, the other the atomic theory of Democritus. Both were in
        strong reaction against the abstractions of Plato and Aristotle, and
        would tolerate nothing but concrete reality. The Stoics were quite as
        materialistic in their own way as the Epicureans. With regard indeed to
        the nature of the highest god we may, with Senaca represent the
        difference between the two schools as a question of the senses against
        the intellect, but we shall see presently that the Stoics regarded the
        intellect itself as being a kind of body.

        The Greeks were all agreed that there was an end or aim of life, and
        that it was to be called 'happiness,' but at that point their agreement
        ended. As to the nature of happiness there was the utmost variety of
        opinion. Democritus had made it consist in mental serenity, Anaxagoras
        in speculation, Socrates in wisdom, Aristotle in the practise of virtue
        with some amount of favour from fortune, Aristippus simply in pleasure.
        These were opinions of the philosophers. But, besides these, there were
        the opinions of ordinary men, as shown by their lives rather than by
        their language. Zeno's contribution to thought on the subject does not
        at first sight appear illuminating. He said that the end was 'to live
        consistently,' the implication doubtless being that no life but the
        passionless life of reason could ultimately be consistent with itself.
        Cleanthes, his immediate successor in the school, is credited with
        having added the words 'with nature,' thus completing the well-known
        Stoic formula that the end is 'to live consistently with nature.'
      </p>

      <p>
        It was assumed by the Greeks that the ways of nature were 'the ways of
        pleasantness,' and that 'all her paths' were 'peace.' This may seem to
        us a startling assumption, but that is because we do not mean by
        'nature' the same thing as they did. We connect the term with the origin
        of a thing, they connected it rather with the end; by the 'natural
        state' we mean a state of savagery, they meant the highest civilization;
        we mean by a thing's nature what it is or has been, they meant what it
        ought to become under the most favourable conditions; not the sour crab,
        but the mellow glory of the Hesperides worthy to be guarded by a
        sleepless dragon, was to the Greeks the natural apple. Hence we find
        Aristotle maintaining that the State is a natural product, because it is
        evolved out of social relations which exist by nature. Nature indeed was
        a highly ambiguous term to the Greeks no less than to ourselves, but in
        the sense with which we are now concerned, the nature of anything was
        defined by the Peripatetics as 'the end of its becoming.' Another
        definition of theirs puts the matter still more clearly. 'What each
        thing is when its growth has been completed, that we declare to be the
        nature of each thing'.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following out this conception the Stoics identified a life in accordance
        with nature with a life in accordance with the highest perfection to
        which man could attain. Now, as man was essentially a rational animal,
        his work as man lay in living the rational life. And the perfection of
        reason was virtue. Hence the ways of nature were no other than the ways
        of virtue. And so it came about that the Stoic formula might be
        expressed in a number of different ways which yet all amounted to the
        same thing. The end was to live the virtuous life, or to live
        consistently, or to live in accordance with nature, or to live
        rationally.
