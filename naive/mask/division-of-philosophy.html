      <h1>Division of Philosophy</h1>

      <p>
        Philosophy was defined by the Stoics as 'the knowledge of things divine
        and human'. It was divided into three departments; logic, ethic, and
        physic. This division indeed was in existence before their time, but
        they have got the credit of it as of some other things which they did
        not originate. Neither was it confined to them, but was part of the
        common stock of thought. Even the Epicureans, who are said to have
        rejected logic can hardly be counted as dissentients from this threefold
        division. For what they did was to substitute for the Stoic logic a
        logic of their own, dealing with the notions derived from sense, much in
        the same way as Bacon substituted his Novum Organum for the Organon of
        Aristotle. Cleanthes we are told recognised six parts of philosophy,
        namely, dialectic, rhetoric, ethic, politic, physic, and theology, but
        these are obviously the result of subdivision of the primary ones. Of
        the three departments we may say that logic deals with the form and
        expression of knowledge, physic with the matter of knowledge, and ethic
        with the use of knowledge. The division may also be justified in this
        way. Philosophy must study either nature (including the divine nature)
        or man; and, if it studies man, it must regard him either from the side
        of the intellect or of the feelings, that is either as a thinking
        (logic) or as an acting (ethic) being.
      </p>

      <p>
        As to the order in which the different departments should be studied, we
        have had preserved to us the actual words of Chrysippus in his fourth
        book on Lives. 'First of all then it seems to me that, as has been
        rightly said by the ancients, there are three heads under which the
        speculations of the philosopher fall, logic, ethic, physic; next, that
        of these the logical should come first, the ethical second, and the
        physical third, and that of the physical the treatment of the gods
        should come last, whence also they have given the name of "completions"
        to the instruction delivered on this subject'. That this order however
        might yield to convenience is plain from another book on the use of
        reason, where he says that 'the student who takes up logic first need
        not entirely abstain from the other branches of philosophy, but should
        study them also as occasion offers.'
      </p>

      <p>
        Plutarch twits Chrysippus with inconsistency, because in the face of
        this declaration as to the order of treatment, he nevertheless says that
        morals rest upon physics. But to this charge it may fairly be replied
        that the order of exposition need not coincide with the order of
        existence. Metaphysically speaking, morals may depend upon physics and
        the right conduct of man be deducible from the structure of the universe
        but for all that, it may be advisable to study physics later. Physics
        meant the nature of God and the Universe. Our nature may be deducible
        from that but it is better known to ourselves to start with, so that it
        may be well to begin from the end of the stick that we have in our
        hands. But that Chrysippus did teach the logical dependence of morals on
        physics is plain from his own words. In his third book on the Gods he
        says 'for it is not possible to find any other origin of justice or mode
        of its generation save that from Zeus and the nature of the universe for
        anything we have to say about good and evil must needs derive its origin
        therefrom', and again in his Physical Theses, 'for there is no other or
        more appropriate way of approaching the subject of good and evil on the
        virtues or happiness than from the nature of all things and the
        administration of the universeâ€”for it is to these we must attach the
        treatment of good and evil inasmuch as there is no better origin to
        which we can refer them and inasmuch as physical speculation is taken in
        solely with a view to the distinction between good and evil.'
      </p>

      <p>
        The last words are worth noting as showing that even with Chrysippus who
        has been called the intellectual founder of Stoicism the whole stress of
        the philosophy of the Porch fell upon its moral teaching. It was a
        favourite metaphor with the school to compare philosophy to a fertile
        vineyard or orchard. Ethic was the good fruit, physic the tall plants,
        and logic the strong wall. The wall existed only to guard the trees, and
        the trees only to produce the fruit. Or again philosophy was likened to
        an egg of which ethic was the yolk containing the chick, physic the
        white which formed its nourishment while logic was the hard outside
        shell. Posidonius, a later member of the school, objected to the
        metaphor from the vineyard on the ground that the fruit and the trees
        and the wall were all separable whereas the parts of philosophy were
        inseparable. He preferred therefore to liken it to a living organism,
        logic being the bones and sinews, physic the flesh and blood, but ethic
        the soul.
